| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Task description: "{description}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas:"{ideas}" Requirements:"{requirements}" Coding plan: "{codes}" Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to decompose the overall coding plans into smaller tasks and assign them to different programmers. The decomposition should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks.  COMPOSITION ``` Task 1: Task 1 description Task 2: Task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Task 1: [] Task 2: [Task 1] ``` Please note that the decomposition should be both effective and efficient. 1) According to the Coding plan, each decomposed task should only be responsible for implementing one code file mentioned in Coding Plan. 2) Data files do not need to be assigned to programmers for implementation. 3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task. 4) The first subtask should implement the backend code, while the REMAINING SUBTASKS should develop the frontend code based on backend codes. 5) Each code file should be assigned only one subtask; multiple subtasks for a single code file are not necessary. 6) If the subtask is to complete the frontend code, it should be explicitly noted in the subtask that all URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names. 7) If the subtask is to complete the backend code, it should include the following clear descriptions: - The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'.  - The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code.  - File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text.  In addition to these descriptions, the subtask should list all frontend code files and incorporate the original task's supplementary condition. 8) The workflow should not contain circles! |

      └── user_experiences.txt"

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to decompose the overall coding plans into smaller tasks and assign them to different programmers.

The decomposition should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks. 

### COMPOSITION

```

Task 1: Task 1 description

Task 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Task 1: []

Task 2: [Task 1]

```

Please note that the decomposition should be both effective and efficient.

1) According to the Coding plan, each decomposed task should only be responsible for implementing one code file mentioned in Coding Plan.

2) Data files do not need to be assigned to programmers for implementation.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.

4) The first subtask should implement the backend code, while the REMAINING SUBTASKS should develop the frontend code based on backend codes.

5) Each code file should be assigned only one subtask; multiple subtasks for a single code file are not necessary.

6) If the subtask is to complete the frontend code, it should be explicitly noted in the subtask that all URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names.

7) If the subtask is to complete the backend code, it should include the following clear descriptions:

    - The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'.

    - The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code.

    - File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text.

In addition to these descriptions, the subtask should list all frontend code files and incorporate the original task's supplementary condition.

8) The workflow should not contain circles!

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 
Task: "".
Modality: "website".
Programming Language: "Python and HTML"
Sub-Task description: "Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle routing for all frontend pages. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'. The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code. File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text. The frontend code files are `login.html`, `festival_overview.html`, `festival_details.html`, and `user_submission.html`."

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes: "{codes}" As the {assistant_role}, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations: 1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000. 2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first. 3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names. 4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code. 5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password. 6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file. 7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision.

This document outlines the essential requirements for the web application, ensuring clarity for development and future testing..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified several areas that require attention. Below is a detailed analysis based on each regulation, followed by the highest priority comment and suggestions for revision.

### Regulation Compliance Check

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The application is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The route for the login page is defined as `@app.route('/')`, which is correct.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** The frontend code uses `url_for` to generate URLs, which is correct.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** The backend code has routes for login, festival overview, festival details, and user submissions, which correspond to the frontend code.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement password encryption, which is acceptable for this example.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** The code reads from the beginning of the data files, which is correct.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** There is a discrepancy in the festival details page regarding the comment submission route. The backend does not have a corresponding route for submitting comments.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment:** The backend code is missing a route for handling comment submissions on the festival details page. The frontend code for `festival_details.html` attempts to submit comments to the URL `/festival/{{ festival.title }}/comment`, but this route is not defined in the backend.

### Suggestions for Revision

1. **Add a Route for Comment Submission:**
   You need to create a new route in `app.py` to handle the comment submission. Here’s how you can implement it:

```python
# Route for submitting comments
@app.route('/festival/<festival_name>/comment', methods=['POST'])
def submit_comment(festival_name):
    comment_name = request.form['comment-name']
    comment_input = request.form['comment-input']
    with open('data/comments.txt', 'a') as f:
        f.write(f"{festival_name};{comment_name};{comment_input}\n")
    return redirect(url_for('festival_details', festival_name=festival_name))
```

2. **Update the `festival_details.html` to include existing comments:**
   You should also ensure that the existing comments are passed to the template when rendering the festival details page. Modify the `festival_details` function in `app.py` to read comments from `comments.txt` and pass them to the template:

```python
# Route for the festival details page
@app.route('/festival/<festival_name>')
def festival_details(festival_name):
    festival_info = {}
    comments = []
    with open('data/festival_data.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            details = line.strip().split(';')
            if details[0] == festival_name:
                festival_info = {
                    'title': details[0],
                    'description': details[1],
                    'date': details[2],
                    'category': details[3],
                    'performers': details[4]
                }
                break
    with open('data/comments.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            comment_details = line.strip().split(';')
            if comment_details[0] == festival_name:
                comments.append(comment_details)
    return render_template('festival_details.html', festival=festival_info, comments=comments)
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the application complies with all regulations and functions correctly.

code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified several areas that require attention. Below is a detailed analysis based on each regulation, followed by the highest priority comment and suggestions for revision.\n\n### Regulation Compliance Check\n\n1. The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.\n   - Compliance: The application is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.\n\n2. The login page can be accessed directly via the route \'/\'. Please confirm whether the \'/\' route exists first.\n   - Compliance: The route for the login page is defined as @app.route(\'/\'), which is correct.\n\n3. The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.\n   - Compliance: The frontend code uses url_for to generate URLs, which is correct.\n\n4. The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.\n   - Compliance: The backend code has routes for login, festival overview, festival details, and user submissions, which correspond to the frontend code.\n\n5. This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.\n   - Compliance: The code does not implement password encryption, which is acceptable for this example.\n\n6. All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.\n   - Compliance: The code reads from the beginning of the data files, which is correct.\n\n7. Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.\n   - Compliance: There is a discrepancy in the festival details page regarding the comment submission route. The backend does not have a corresponding route for submitting comments.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment\n\nComment: The backend code is missing a route for handling comment submissions on the festival details page. The frontend code for festival_details.html attempts to submit comments to the URL /festival/{{ festival.title }}/comment, but this route is not defined in the backend.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision\n\n1. Add a Route for Comment Submission:\n   You need to create a new route in app.py to handle the comment submission. Here’s how you can implement it:\n\npython\n# Route for submitting comments\n@app.route(\'/festival/&lt;festival_name&gt;/comment\', methods=[\'POST\'])\ndef submit_comment(festival_name):\n    comment_name = request.form[\'comment-name\']\n    comment_input = request.form[\'comment-input\']\n    with open(\'data/comments.txt\', \'a\') as f:\n        f.write(f"{festival_name};{comment_name};{comment_input}\\n")\n    return redirect(url_for(\'festival_details\', festival_name=festival_name))\n\n\n2. Update the festival_details.html to include existing comments:\n   You should also ensure that the existing comments are passed to the template when rendering the festival details page. Modify the festival_details function in app.py to read comments from comments.txt and pass them to the template:\n\npython\n# Route for the festival details page\n@app.route(\'/festival/&lt;festival_name&gt;\')\ndef festival_details(festival_name):\n    festival_info = {}\n    comments = []\n    with open(\'data/festival_data.txt\', \'r\') as f:\n        for line in f:\n            details = line.strip().split(\';\')\n            if details[0] == festival_name:\n                festival_info = {\n                    \'title\': details[0],\n                    \'description\': details[1],\n                    \'date\': details[2],\n                    \'category\': details[3],\n                    \'performers\': details[4]\n                }\n                break\n    with open(\'data/comments.txt\', \'r\') as f:\n        for line in f:\n            comment_details = line.strip().split(\';\')\n            if comment_details[0] == festival_name:\n                comments.append(comment_details)\n    return render_template(\'festival_details.html\', festival=festival_info, comments=comments)\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the application complies with all regulations and functions correctly.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified several areas that require attention. Below is a detailed analysis based on each regulation, followed by the highest priority comment and suggestions for revision.

### Regulation Compliance Check

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The application is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The route for the login page is defined as `@app.route('/')`, which is correct.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** The frontend code uses `url_for` to generate URLs, which is correct.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** The backend code has routes for login, festival overview, festival details, and user submissions, which correspond to the frontend code.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement password encryption, which is acceptable for this example.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** The code reads from the beginning of the data files, which is correct.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** There is a discrepancy in the festival details page regarding the comment submission route. The backend does not have a corresponding route for submitting comments.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment:** The backend code is missing a route for handling comment submissions on the festival details page. The frontend code for `festival_details.html` attempts to submit comments to the URL `/festival/{{ festival.title }}/comment`, but this route is not defined in the backend.

### Suggestions for Revision

1. **Add a Route for Comment Submission:**
   You need to create a new route in `app.py` to handle the comment submission. Here’s how you can implement it:

```python
# Route for submitting comments
@app.route('/festival/<festival_name>/comment', methods=['POST'])
def submit_comment(festival_name):
    comment_name = request.form['comment-name']
    comment_input = request.form['comment-input']
    with open('data/comments.txt', 'a') as f:
        f.write(f"{festival_name};{comment_name};{comment_input}\n")
    return redirect(url_for('festival_details', festival_name=festival_name))
```

2. **Update the `festival_details.html` to include existing comments:**
   You should also ensure that the existing comments are passed to the template when rendering the festival details page. Modify the `festival_details` function in `app.py` to read comments from `comments.txt` and pass them to the template:

```python
# Route for the festival details page
@app.route('/festival/<festival_name>')
def festival_details(festival_name):
    festival_info = {}
    comments = []
    with open('data/festival_data.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            details = line.strip().split(';')
            if details[0] == festival_name:
                festival_info = {
                    'title': details[0],
                    'description': details[1],
                    'date': details[2],
                    'category': details[3],
                    'performers': details[4]
                }
                break
    with open('data/comments.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            comment_details = line.strip().split(';')
            if comment_details[0] == festival_name:
                comments.append(comment_details)
    return render_template('festival_details.html', festival=festival_info, comments=comments)
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the application complies with all regulations and functions correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

| **phase_prompt** | According to the software requirements listed below:  Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Your goal is to organize a testing team to complete the software development task. There are two default testing tasks:  1) Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000. In this test, you only need to test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local 5000 port. 2) Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task. In addition, there are other testing tasks as well: You need to assign ONE testing task to test the elements and integrity of ALL pages. In order to write testing code, you need to clearly describe the elements that need to be included in each page in this testing task, taking into account the original task requirements. Follow the format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of testing tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks.  COMPOSITION ``` Task 1: Testing task 1 description Task 2: Testing task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Task 1: [] Task 2: [Task 1] ``` Please note that:  1) the format of your answer must strictly comply with the above form. Your description of the testing task must be in "COMPOSITION"; 2) you don't need to modify the description of the default testing task. |

Here is the implementation of the test case as per your requirements:

test_requirement_1.py
```python
'''
Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000 and verify the login page.
'''
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class TestLoginPageAccess(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Initialize the Chrome WebDriver
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_access(self):
        driver = self.driver
        # Wait for the page to load

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

file name: app.py  
function name: login, festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience, submit_comment  
detailed analysis of the problem: The test for successful login fails because the login route is not properly handling the login logic. The login form in `login.html` submits to `/login`, but there is no route defined in `app.py` to handle this path. Consequently, the application returns a 404 error when trying to access the festival overview page after a successful login. Additionally, the test for failed login cannot find the error message element because the login logic does not provide feedback for incorrect credentials, leading to the absence of the `error-message` element in the DOM.

file name: login.html  
function name: N/A  
detailed analysis of the problem: The login form in `login.html` is set to submit to the `/login` route, which does not exist in `app.py`. This results in a 404 error when attempting to log in. To fix this, a route should be added in `app.py` to handle the login logic and provide appropriate responses for both successful and failed login attempts.

- User Submissions Page  Check for the presence of `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`."
According to Testing Task description, please write test cases to locate the bugs, note that logging is important, ensure the content and format is right. 
You should first locate the functions that need to be tested and write the test cases for them according to the testing task description.
The output must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is "test_requirement_3.py", "LANGUAGE" in the programming language,"REQUIREMENTS" is the targeted requirement of the test case, and "CODE" is the test code that is used to test the specific requirement of the file. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
REQUIREMENTS
'''
CODE
```
You will implement the "test_requirement_3.py" and finish it follows in the strictly defined format.
Please note that:
1. Please adhere strictly to the Testing Task description to develop unit test code for the web application using Python, Selenium, and unittest framework. 
2. The test code needs to be directly executable and only need to cover the tests required by the Testing Task description.

file name: app.py  
function name: festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  
detailed analysis of the problem: The errors in the test execution indicate that the elements expected on the festival overview page and festival details page are not being found. This could be due to the fact that the login functionality is not implemented in the `app.py` file, which means that the tests are not able to navigate past the login page. The test cases assume that the user is already logged in, but since there is no handling for the login process, the subsequent pages are not being rendered, leading to the `NoSuchElementException`. Additionally, the login form action in `login.html` is set to "/login", but there is no corresponding route in `app.py` to handle this action. This needs to be addressed to ensure proper navigation and element presence on the pages.

| **phase_prompt** | You are now a organization fine-tuner for the software development process.  Your task is to update the coding agent teams to ensure that the software requirements can be achieved. The overall requirements, current coding agent teams, and the issues in current implementation of the software are listed below:  Requirements: "{task}" Coding team composition: "{composition}". Coding team workflow: : "{workflow}". Source codes: "{codes}" Current issues: "{issues}". As the {assistant_role}, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase. The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks. COMPOSITION ``` Programmer 1: Task 1 description Programmer 2: Task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Programmer 1: [] Programmer 2: [Programmer 1] ``` Please note that: 1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file. 2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues: - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.  - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.  - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.  3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.  4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts.  5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks.  6) The workflow should not contain circles! |

The login form in login.html submits to /login, but there is no route defined in app.py to handle this path. Consequently, the application returns a 404 error when trying to access the festival overview page after a successful login. Additionally, the test for failed login cannot find the error message element because the login logic does not provide feedback for incorrect credentials, leading to the absence of the error-message element in the DOM.\n\nfile name: login.html  \nfunction name: N/A  \ndetailed analysis of the problem: The login form in login.html is set to submit to the /login route, which does not exist in app.py. This results in a 404 error when attempting to log in. To fix this, a route should be added in app.py to handle the login logic and provide appropriate responses for both successful and failed login attempts.\nTest the elements and integrity of ALL pages, ensuring that each page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document. This includes \n- Login Page  Check for the presence of login-form, username, password, login-button, and error-message.\n- Festival Overview Page  Check for the presence of festivals-list, festival_item_&lt;index&gt; for each festival, and submit-experience-button.\n- Festival Details Page  Check for the presence of festival-title, festival-info, comments-section, comment-name, comment-input, submit-comment-button, and back-button.\n- User Submissions Page  Check for the presence of submission-form, user-name, experience-description, submit-button, and success-message.\nError Summary: file name: app.py  \nfunction name: festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  \ndetailed analysis of the problem: The errors in the test execution indicate that the elements expected on the festival overview page and festival details page are not being found. This could be due to the fact that the login functionality is not implemented in the app.py file, which means that the tests are not able to navigate past the login page. The test cases assume that the user is already logged in, but since there is no handling for the login process, the subsequent pages are not being rendered, leading to the NoSuchElementException. Additionally, the login form action in login.html is set to "/login", but there is no corresponding route in app.py to handle this action.

Current issues: "Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000. In this test, you only need to test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local 5000 port.
Error Summary: No error in codes.
Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task.
Error Summary: file name: app.py  
function name: login, festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience, submit_comment  
detailed analysis of the problem: The test for successful login fails because the login route is not properly handling the login logic. The login form in `login.html` submits to `/login`, but there is no route defined in `app.py` to handle this path. Consequently, the application returns a 404 error when trying to access the festival overview page after a successful login. Additionally, the test for failed login cannot find the error message element because the login logic does not provide feedback for incorrect credentials, leading to the absence of the `error-message` element in the DOM.

file name: login.html  
function name: N/A  
detailed analysis of the problem: The login form in `login.html` is set to submit to the `/login` route, which does not exist in `app.py`. This results in a 404 error when attempting to log in. To fix this, a route should be added in `app.py` to handle the login logic and provide appropriate responses for both successful and failed login attempts.
Test the elements and integrity of ALL pages, ensuring that each page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document. This includes 
- Login Page  Check for the presence of `login-form`, `username`, `password`, `login-button`, and `error-message`.
- Festival Overview Page  Check for the presence of `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`.
- Festival Details Page  Check for the presence of `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`.
- User Submissions Page  Check for the presence of `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`.

function name: festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  
detailed analysis of the problem: The errors in the test execution indicate that the elements expected on the festival overview page and festival details page are not being found. This could be due to the fact that the login functionality is not implemented in the `app.py` file, which means that the tests are not able to navigate past the login page. The test cases assume that the user is already logged in, but since there is no handling for the login process, the subsequent pages are not being rendered, leading to the `NoSuchElementException`. Additionally, the login form action in `login.html` is set to "/login", but there is no corresponding route in `app.py` to handle this action. This needs to be addressed to ensure proper navigation and element presence on the pages.
".

As the Programmer, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase.

The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks.

### COMPOSITION

```

Programmer 1: Task 1 description

Programmer 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Programmer 1: []

Programmer 2: [Programmer 1]

```

Please note that:

1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file.

2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues:

    - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.

    - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.

    - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task. 

4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts. 

5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks. 

6) The workflow should not contain circles!

Programmer 1: Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle the login logic. This includes creating a route for `/login` that processes the login form submission, checks the provided credentials against the `user_data.txt` file, and redirects the user to the festival overview page upon successful login. If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area.

Programmer 2: Develop the frontend code for the login page in `login.html`. This page should include a form for user login with the specified element IDs and should route to the backend for login processing. Ensure that the form action points to the correct route for login processing.

Programmer 3: Develop the frontend code for the festival overview page in `festival_overview.html`. This page should display a list of available cultural festivals and include a button to navigate to the user submissions page. Ensure that it correctly retrieves and displays the festival data from the backend.

Programmer 4: Develop the frontend code for the festival details page in `festival_details.html`. This page should display detailed information about the selected festival and allow users to leave comments. Ensure that it retrieves the festival details and existing comments from the backend.

Programmer 5: Develop the frontend code for the user submissions page in `user_submission.html`. This page should include a form for users to submit their experiences and display a success message upon submission. Ensure that it correctly processes the submission and provides feedback to the user.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format: FILENAME LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE |

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes: "{codes}" As the {assistant_role}, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations: 1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000. 2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first. 3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names. 4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code. 5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password. 6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file. 7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision.

This document outlines the essential requirements for the web application, ensuring clarity for development and future testing..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, here are my findings regarding compliance with each regulation:

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The code is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The route for the login page (`'/'`) is defined in the backend code with the function `login()`, which returns the `login.html` template.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for()` function to generate URLs, which is correct.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond correctly to the frontend code.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement any password encryption, which is in line with the requirement.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** The code reads from the beginning of each data file, which is correct.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** All function names and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `submit_experience()` function does not handle the case where the user submits an experience without being logged in. This could lead to confusion or errors if a user tries to submit their experience without first logging in.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement User Authentication Check:**
   - Before allowing users to submit their experience, check if they are logged in. You can use Flask's session management to track logged-in users.

2. **Modify the `submit_experience()` function:**
   - Add a check at the beginning of the function to see if the user is logged in. If not, redirect them back to the login page with an appropriate error message.

Here’s how you can implement this:

```python
from flask import session

# Add this check at the beginning of the submit_experience function
@app.route('/submit_experience', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit_experience():
    if 'username' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in
        return redirect(url_for('login', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_name = request.form['user-name']
        experience_description = request.form['experience-description']
        with open('data/user_experiences.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\n")
        return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")
    
    return render_template('user_submission.html')
```

### Additional Steps:
- Ensure to set the session variable upon successful login in the `handle_login()` function:
```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def handle_login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    with open('data/user_data.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            stored_username, stored_password = line.strip().split(',')
            if stored_username == username and stored_password == password:
                session['username'] = username  # Set session variable
                return redirect(url_for('festival_overview'))
    return render_template('login.html', error="Invalid username or password.")
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that users must be logged in to submit their experiences, enhancing the overall user experience and security of the application.

[2024-22-09 17:58:22 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, here are my findings regarding compliance with each regulation:

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The code is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The route for the login page (`'/'`) is defined in the backend code with the function `login()`, which returns the `login.html` template.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for()` function to generate URLs, which is correct.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond correctly to the frontend code.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement any password encryption, which is in line with the requirement.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** The code reads from the beginning of each data file, which is correct.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** All function names and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `submit_experience()` function does not handle the case where the user submits an experience without being logged in. This could lead to confusion or errors if a user tries to submit their experience without first logging in.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement User Authentication Check:**
   - Before allowing users to submit their experience, check if they are logged in. You can use Flask's session management to track logged-in users.

2. **Modify the `submit_experience()` function:**
   - Add a check at the beginning of the function to see if the user is logged in. If not, redirect them back to the login page with an appropriate error message.

Here’s how you can implement this:

```python
from flask import session

# Add this check at the beginning of the submit_experience function
@app.route('/submit_experience', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit_experience():
    if 'username' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in
        return redirect(url_for('login', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_name = request.form['user-name']
        experience_description = request.form['experience-description']
        with open('data/user_experiences.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\n")
        return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")
    
    return render_template('user_submission.html')
```

### Additional Steps:
- Ensure to set the session variable upon successful login in the `handle_login()` function:
```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def handle_login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    with open('data/user_data.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            stored_username, stored_password = line.strip().split(',')
            if stored_username == username and stored_password == password:
                session['username'] = username  # Set session variable
                return redirect(url_for('festival_overview'))
    return render_template('login.html', error="Invalid username or password.")
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that users must be logged in to submit their experiences, enhancing the overall user experience and security of the application.

'After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, here are my findings regarding compliance with each regulation:\n\n1. The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.\n   - Compliance: The code is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.\n\n2. The login page can be accessed directly via the route \'/\'. Please confirm whether the \'/\' route exists first.\n   - Compliance: The route for the login page (\'/\') is defined in the backend code with the function login(), which returns the login.html template.\n\n3. The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.\n   - Compliance: The frontend code uses Flask\'s url_for() function to generate URLs, which is correct.\n\n4. The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.\n   - Compliance: All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond correctly to the frontend code.\n\n5. This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.\n   - Compliance: The code does not implement any password encryption, which is in line with the requirement.\n\n6. All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.\n   - Compliance: The code reads from the beginning of each data file, which is correct.\n\n7. Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.\n   - Compliance: All function names and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nComment: The submit_experience() function does not handle the case where the user submits an experience without being logged in. This could lead to confusion or errors if a user tries to submit their experience without first logging in.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision:\n1. Implement User Authentication Check:\n   - Before allowing users to submit their experience, check if they are logged in. You can use Flask\'s session management to track logged-in users.\n\n2. Modify the submit_experience() function:\n   - Add a check at the beginning of the function to see if the user is logged in. If not, redirect them back to the login page with an appropriate error message.\n\nHere’s how you can implement this:\n\npython\nfrom flask import session\n\n# Add this check at the beginning of the submit_experience function\n@app.route(\'/submit_experience\', methods=[\'GET\', \'POST\'])\ndef submit_experience():\n    if \'username\' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in\n        return redirect(url_for(\'login\', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))\n    \n    if request.method == \'POST\':\n        user_name = request.form[\'user-name\']\n        experience_description = request.form[\'experience-description\']\n        with open(\'data/user_experiences.txt\', \'a\') as f:\n            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\\n")\n        return render_template(\'user_submission.html\', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")\n    \n    return render_template(\'user_submission.html\')\n\n\n### Additional Steps:\n- Ensure to set the session variable upon successful login in the handle_login() function:\npython\n@app.route(\'/login\', methods=[\'POST\'])\ndef handle_login():\n    username = request.form[\'username\']\n    password = request.form[\'password\']\n    with open(\'data/user_data.txt\', \'r\') as f:\n        for line in f:\n            stored_username, stored_password = line.strip().split(\',\')\n            if stored_username == username and stored_password == password:\n                session[\'username\'] = username  # Set session variable\n                return redirect(url_for(\'festival_overview\'))\n    return render_template(\'login.html\', error="Invalid username or password.")\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that users must be logged in to submit their experiences, enhancing the overall user experience and security of the application.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, here are my findings regarding compliance with each regulation:

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The code is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The route for the login page (`'/'`) is defined in the backend code with the function `login()`, which returns the `login.html` template.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for()` function to generate URLs, which is correct.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond correctly to the frontend code.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement any password encryption, which is in line with the requirement.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** The code reads from the beginning of each data file, which is correct.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** All function names and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment:** The `submit_experience()` function does not handle the case where the user submits an experience without being logged in. This could lead to confusion or errors if a user tries to submit their experience without first logging in.

### Suggestions for Revision:
1. **Implement User Authentication Check:**
   - Before allowing users to submit their experience, check if they are logged in. You can use Flask's session management to track logged-in users.

2. **Modify the `submit_experience()` function:**
   - Add a check at the beginning of the function to see if the user is logged in. If not, redirect them back to the login page with an appropriate error message.

Here’s how you can implement this:

```python
from flask import session

# Add this check at the beginning of the submit_experience function
@app.route('/submit_experience', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit_experience():
    if 'username' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in
        return redirect(url_for('login', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_name = request.form['user-name']
        experience_description = request.form['experience-description']
        with open('data/user_experiences.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\n")
        return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")
    
    return render_template('user_submission.html')
```

### Additional Steps:
- Ensure to set the session variable upon successful login in the `handle_login()` function:
```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def handle_login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    with open('data/user_data.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            stored_username, stored_password = line.strip().split(',')
            if stored_username == username and stored_password == password:
                session['username'] = username  # Set session variable
                return redirect(url_for('festival_overview'))
    return render_template('login.html', error="Invalid username or password.")
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that users must be logged in to submit their experiences, enhancing the overall user experience and security of the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

2. The test code needs to be directly executable and only need to cover the tests required by the Testing Task description.
3. Chrome WebDriver is already installed and the path is in the environment variable, so there is no need to specify its path in the test code. And 'WebDriver' object has no attribute 'find_element_by_id'
4. Access to the login page is available at http://localhost:5000. Navigation is restricted to http://localhost:5000 exclusively via the driver.get() method; navigation to other URLs is not allowed.
5. You must utilize the username and password from Data Storage to construct a login method within the test class. 
6. Access to All pages, except for the login and registration pages, requires logging in from the login page and then proceeding by clicking the corresponding buttons on the page to navigate to the desired page.
7. After logging in, you will be redirected to other pages and will not stay on the login page.

file name: app.py  
function name: handle_login, festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  
detailed analysis of the problem: The test reports indicate that the elements expected on the festival overview and details pages are not found during the tests. This could be due to the fact that the login process may not be completing successfully, which would prevent the user from accessing the subsequent pages. The test for the login page does not check if the login was successful before proceeding to the festival overview page. Additionally, the test for the festival details page may not be correctly navigating to the festival details after the overview, which could lead to the elements not being present. It is essential to ensure that the login credentials are valid and that the navigation flow is correctly followed in the tests. 

file name: login.html  
function name: N/A  
detailed analysis of the problem: The login page appears to be implemented correctly, but the tests do not verify the successful login before proceeding to the festival overview page. If the login fails, the user will remain on the login page, and the subsequent tests will fail to find elements on the festival overview and details pages. It is crucial to ensure that the tests include a check for successful login and handle any potential login errors before proceeding to test the other pages.

| **phase_prompt** | You are now a organization fine-tuner for the software development process.  Your task is to update the coding agent teams to ensure that the software requirements can be achieved. The overall requirements, current coding agent teams, and the issues in current implementation of the software are listed below:  Requirements: "{task}" Coding team composition: "{composition}". Coding team workflow: : "{workflow}". Source codes: "{codes}" Current issues: "{issues}". As the {assistant_role}, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase. The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks. COMPOSITION ``` Programmer 1: Task 1 description Programmer 2: Task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Programmer 1: [] Programmer 2: [Programmer 1] ``` Please note that: 1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file. 2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues: - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.  - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.  - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.  3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.  4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts.  5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks.  6) The workflow should not contain circles! |

Error Summary: file name: app.py  
function name: handle_login, festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  
detailed analysis of the problem: The test reports indicate that the elements expected on the festival overview and details pages are not found during the tests. This could be due to the fact that the login process may not be completing successfully, which would prevent the user from accessing the subsequent pages. The test for the login page does not check if the login was successful before proceeding to the festival overview page. Additionally, the test for the festival details page may not be correctly navigating to the festival details after the overview, which could lead to the elements not being present. It is essential to ensure that the login credentials are valid and that the navigation flow is correctly followed in the tests. 

file name: login.html  
function name: N/A  
detailed analysis of the problem: The login page appears to be implemented correctly, but the tests do not verify the successful login before proceeding to the festival overview page. If the login fails, the user will remain on the login page, and the subsequent tests will fail to find elements on the festival overview and details pages. It is crucial to ensure that the tests include a check for successful login and handle any potential login errors before proceeding to test the other pages.
".

As the Programmer, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase.

The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks.

### COMPOSITION

```

Programmer 1: Task 1 description

Programmer 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Programmer 1: []

Programmer 2: [Programmer 1]

```

Please note that:

1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file.

2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues:

    - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.

    - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.

    - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task. 

4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts. 

5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks. 

6) The workflow should not contain circles!

### COMPOSITION

```
Programmer 1: Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle the login logic. This includes creating a route for `/login` that processes the login form submission, checks the provided credentials against the `user_data.txt` file, and redirects the user to the festival overview page upon successful login. If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area. Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation.

Programmer 2: Develop the frontend code for the festival overview page in `festival_overview.html`. This page should display a list of available cultural festivals and include a button to navigate to the user submissions page. Ensure that it correctly retrieves and displays the festival data from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`.

Programmer 3: Develop the frontend code for the festival details page in `festival_details.html`. This page should display detailed information about the selected festival and allow users to leave comments. Ensure that it retrieves the festival details and existing comments from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`.

Programmer 4: Develop the frontend code for the user submissions page in `user_submission.html`. This page should include a form for users to submit their experiences and display a success message upon submission. Ensure that it correctly processes the submission and provides feedback to the user. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`.
```

### WORKFLOW

```
Programmer 1: []

Programmer 2: [Programmer 1]

Programmer 3: [Programmer 2]

Programmer 4: [Programmer 3]
``` 

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Programmer 1** is retained to ensure the login logic is correctly implemented and integrated with the festival overview and details pages. This addresses the issue of navigation flow after login.
   
2. **Programmer 2** is tasked with developing the festival overview page, ensuring it retrieves data correctly and contains all required elements. This is dependent on Programmer 1's successful login implementation.

3. **Programmer 3** is responsible for the festival details page, which relies on the successful retrieval of festival data from the overview page, thus dependent on Programmer 2.

 ### COMPOSITION

```
Programmer 1: Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle the login logic. This includes creating a route for `/login` that processes the login form submission, checks the provided credentials against the `user_data.txt` file, and redirects the user to the festival overview page upon successful login. If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area. Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation.

Programmer 2: Develop the frontend code for the festival overview page in `festival_overview.html`. This page should display a list of available cultural festivals and include a button to navigate to the user submissions page. Ensure that it correctly retrieves and displays the festival data from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`.

Programmer 3: Develop the frontend code for the festival details page in `festival_details.html`. This page should display detailed information about the selected festival and allow users to leave comments. Ensure that it retrieves the festival details and existing comments from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`.

Programmer 4: Develop the frontend code for the user submissions page in `user_submission.html`. This page should include a form for users to submit their experiences and display a success message upon submission. Ensure that it correctly processes the submission and provides feedback to the user. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`.
```

### WORKFLOW

```
Programmer 1: []

Programmer 2: [Programmer 1]

Programmer 3: [Programmer 2]

Programmer 4: [Programmer 3]
``` 

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Programmer 1** is retained to ensure the login logic is correctly implemented and integrated with the festival overview and details pages. This addresses the issue of navigation flow after login.
   
2. **Programmer 2** is tasked with developing the festival overview page, ensuring it retrieves data correctly and contains all required elements. This is dependent on Programmer 1's successful login implementation.

3. **Programmer 3** is responsible for the festival details page, which relies on the successful retrieval of festival data from the overview page, thus dependent on Programmer 2.

4. **Programmer 4** is assigned to the user submissions page, which depends on the successful display of festival details from Programmer 3.

This structure ensures that each programmer's task is clearly defined, with dependencies laid out to facilitate collaboration and address the identified issues effectively.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes: "{codes}" As the {assistant_role}, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations: 1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000. 2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first. 3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names. 4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code. 5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password. 6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file. 7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision.

```

This document outlines the essential requirements for the web application, ensuring clarity for development and future testing..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, here are my findings:

### Compliance Check Against Regulations

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The application is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The route for the login page (`@app.route('/')`) exists and is correctly implemented.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** All URLs in the frontend code use Flask's `url_for()` function, which is correct.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond to the frontend code.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement password encryption, which is in line with the requirement.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** All file read operations start from the first line, which is correct.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** All functions and URLs correspond correctly between the frontend and backend code.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment:** The `submit_experience` function does not check if the user is logged in before allowing the submission of experiences. This could lead to unauthorized submissions if a user accesses the URL directly without logging in.

**Instructions on How to Fix:**
1. Ensure that the `submit_experience` function checks for the user's session at the beginning of the function. If the user is not logged in, redirect them to the login page with an appropriate error message.

Here’s how you can modify the `submit_experience` function:

```python
@app.route('/submit_experience', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit_experience():
    if 'username' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in
        return redirect(url_for('login', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_name = request.form['user-name']
        experience_description = request.form['experience-description']
        with open('data/user_experiences.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\n")
        return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")
    return render_template('user_submission.html')
```

This ensures that only logged-in users can submit their experiences, maintaining the integrity of the application.

'After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, here are my findings:\n\n### Compliance Check Against Regulations\n\n1. The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.\n   - Compliance: The application is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.\n\n2. The login page can be accessed directly via the route \'/\'. Please confirm whether the \'/\' route exists first.\n   - Compliance: The route for the login page (@app.route(\'/\')) exists and is correctly implemented.\n\n3. The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.\n   - Compliance: All URLs in the frontend code use Flask\'s url_for() function, which is correct.\n\n4. The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.\n   - Compliance: All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond to the frontend code.\n\n5. This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.\n   - Compliance: The code does not implement password encryption, which is in line with the requirement.\n\n6. All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.\n   - Compliance: All file read operations start from the first line, which is correct.\n\n7. Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.\n   - Compliance: All functions and URLs correspond correctly between the frontend and backend code.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment\n\nComment: The submit_experience function does not check if the user is logged in before allowing the submission of experiences. This could lead to unauthorized submissions if a user accesses the URL directly without logging in.\n\nInstructions on How to Fix:\n1. Ensure that the submit_experience function checks for the user\'s session at the beginning of the function. If the user is not logged in, redirect them to the login page with an appropriate error message.\n\nHere’s how you can modify the submit_experience function:\n\npython\n@app.route(\'/submit_experience\', methods=[\'GET\', \'POST\'])\ndef submit_experience():\n    if \'username\' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in\n        return redirect(url_for(\'login\', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))\n    if request.method == \'POST\':\n        user_name = request.form[\'user-name\']\n        experience_description = request.form[\'experience-description\']\n        with open(\'data/user_experiences.txt\', \'a\') as f:\n            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\\n")\n        return render_template(\'user_submission.html\', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")\n    return render_template(\'user_submission.html\')\n\n\nThis ensures that only logged-in users can submit their experiences, maintaining the integrity of the application.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, here are my findings:

### Compliance Check Against Regulations

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The application is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The route for the login page (`@app.route('/')`) exists and is correctly implemented.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** All URLs in the frontend code use Flask's `url_for()` function, which is correct.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond to the frontend code.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement password encryption, which is in line with the requirement.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** All file read operations start from the first line, which is correct.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** All functions and URLs correspond correctly between the frontend and backend code.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment:** The `submit_experience` function does not check if the user is logged in before allowing the submission of experiences. This could lead to unauthorized submissions if a user accesses the URL directly without logging in.

**Instructions on How to Fix:**
1. Ensure that the `submit_experience` function checks for the user's session at the beginning of the function. If the user is not logged in, redirect them to the login page with an appropriate error message.

Here’s how you can modify the `submit_experience` function:

```python
@app.route('/submit_experience', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit_experience():
    if 'username' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in
        return redirect(url_for('login', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_name = request.form['user-name']
        experience_description = request.form['experience-description']
        with open('data/user_experiences.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\n")
        return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")
    return render_template('user_submission.html')
```

This ensures that only logged-in users can submit their experiences, maintaining the integrity of the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class TestLoginPageAccess(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_access(self):
        driver = self.driver
        # Check if the login form is present
        try:

            self.assertIsNotNone(login_form, "Login form is not found on the page.")
            print("Login page accessed successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error accessing login page: {e}")

test_requirement_1.py
```python
'''
Test whether the login page of the Online Cultural Festivals web application can be accessed through local port 5000.
'''
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class TestLoginPageAccess(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_access(self):
        driver = self.driver
        # Check if the login form is present
        try:
            login_form = driver.find_element(By.ID, "login-form")
            self.assertIsNotNone(login_form, "Login form is not found on the page.")
            print("Login page accessed successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error accessing login page: {e}")

    def tearDown(self):
        time.sleep(2)  # Wait for a while to observe the result
        self.driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
``` 

This code uses the `unittest` framework to test the accessibility of the login page at `http://localhost:5000`. It checks for the presence of the login form and logs the result.

This code defines a set of unit tests using the `unittest` framework and `Selenium` for browser automation. Each test method checks for the presence of required elements on the specified pages, ensuring that the web application meets the requirements outlined in the task description. The `setUp` method initializes the WebDriver and logs in before running the tests, while the `tearDown` method ensures that the browser is closed after the tests are complete.

detailed analysis of the problem: The test failures indicate that the elements expected on the pages are not being found. This could be due to the fact that the test cases are not waiting long enough for the page to load before attempting to find elements. Additionally, the login process may not be completing successfully, which would prevent the user from accessing the festival overview and details pages. It is important to ensure that the login credentials used in the tests match the entries in the `user_data.txt` file. If the login fails, the subsequent tests for the festival overview and details pages will also fail because the user is not authenticated.

detailed analysis of the problem: The login page appears to be functioning correctly based on the source code provided. However, if the login credentials are incorrect or if the page is not rendering properly, it could lead to the failure of tests that depend on successful login. It is crucial to verify that the HTML structure matches the expected IDs and that the form submission is correctly handled by the backend. If the login form is not submitting correctly, the user will not be redirected to the festival overview page, leading to failures in the tests that check for elements on that page.

| **phase_prompt** | You are now a organization fine-tuner for the software development process.  Your task is to update the coding agent teams to ensure that the software requirements can be achieved. The overall requirements, current coding agent teams, and the issues in current implementation of the software are listed below:  Requirements: "{task}" Coding team composition: "{composition}". Coding team workflow: : "{workflow}". Source codes: "{codes}" Current issues: "{issues}". As the {assistant_role}, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase. The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks. COMPOSITION ``` Programmer 1: Task 1 description Programmer 2: Task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Programmer 1: [] Programmer 2: [Programmer 1] ``` Please note that: 1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file. 2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues: - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.  - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.  - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.  3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.  4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts.  5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks.  6) The workflow should not contain circles! |

Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation.', 'Programmer 2': 'Develop the frontend code for the festival overview page in `festival_overview.html`. This page should display a list of available cultural festivals and include a button to navigate to the user submissions page.

Current issues: "Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000. In this test, you only need to test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local 5000 port.
Error Summary: No error in codes.
Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task.
Error Summary: No error in codes.
Test the elements and integrity of ALL pages, ensuring that each page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document. This includes 
- Login Page  Check for the presence of `login-form`, `username`, `password`, `login-button`, and `error-message`.
- Festival Overview Page  Check for the presence of `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`.
- Festival Details Page  Check for the presence of `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`.
- User Submissions Page  Check for the presence of `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`.
Error Summary: file name: app.py  
function name: handle_login, festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  
detailed analysis of the problem: The test failures indicate that the elements expected on the pages are not being found. This could be due to the fact that the test cases are not waiting long enough for the page to load before attempting to find elements. Additionally, the login process may not be completing successfully, which would prevent the user from accessing the festival overview and details pages. It is important to ensure that the login credentials used in the tests match the entries in the `user_data.txt` file. If the login fails, the subsequent tests for the festival overview and details pages will also fail because the user is not authenticated. 

file name: login.html  
function name: N/A  
detailed analysis of the problem: The login page appears to be functioning correctly based on the source code provided. However, if the login credentials are incorrect or if the page is not rendering properly, it could lead to the failure of tests that depend on successful login. It is crucial to verify that the HTML structure matches the expected IDs and that the form submission is correctly handled by the backend. If the login form is not submitting correctly, the user will not be redirected to the festival overview page, leading to failures in the tests that check for elements on that page.
".

As the Programmer, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase.

The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks.

### COMPOSITION

```

Programmer 1: Task 1 description

Programmer 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Programmer 1: []

Programmer 2: [Programmer 1]

```

Please note that:

1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file.

2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues:

    - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.

    - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.

    - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task. 

4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts. 

5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks. 

6) The workflow should not contain circles!

### COMPOSITION

```
Programmer 1: Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle the login logic. This includes creating a route for `/login` that processes the login form submission, checks the provided credentials against the `user_data.txt` file, and redirects the user to the festival overview page upon successful login. If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area. Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation. Address the issue where the login process may not be completing successfully, which prevents access to subsequent pages.

Programmer 2: Develop the frontend code for the festival overview page in `festival_overview.html`. This page should display a list of available cultural festivals and include a button to navigate to the user submissions page. Ensure that it correctly retrieves and displays the festival data from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.

Programmer 3: Develop the frontend code for the festival details page in `festival_details.html`. This page should display detailed information about the selected festival and allow users to leave comments. Ensure that it retrieves the festival details and existing comments from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.

Programmer 4: Develop the frontend code for the user submissions page in `user_submission.html`. This page should include a form for users to submit their experiences and display a success message upon submission. Ensure that it correctly processes the submission and provides feedback to the user. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format: FILENAME LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE |

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes: "{codes}" As the {assistant_role}, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations: 1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000. 2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first. 3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names. 4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code. 5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password. 6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file. 7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations.

```

This document outlines the essential requirements for the web application, ensuring clarity for development and future testing..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

After reviewing the provided code and requirements, here are the findings based on the regulations set forth by ChatDev:

### Regulation Compliance Check

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The Flask app is set to run on port 5000, so this regulation is met.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The route for the login page is defined as `@app.route('/')`, which is correct.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** All URLs in the frontend code use `url_for()` to reference the backend routes, which is correct.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond to the frontend code.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement any password encryption, which is in line with this regulation.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** The code reads from the beginning of the files, so this regulation is met.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** All functions and URLs correspond correctly, with no discrepancies found.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment:** The `submit_experience` function does not handle the case where the user is not logged in properly. If a user tries to submit their experience without being logged in, they are redirected to the login page, but the error message is not displayed. This could lead to confusion for the user.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
To improve user experience, modify the `submit_experience` function to pass an error message back to the login page if the user is redirected due to not being logged in. Here’s how you can implement this:

```python
# Route for the user submissions page
@app.route('/submit_experience', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit_experience():
    if 'username' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in
        return redirect(url_for('login', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_name = request.form['user-name']
        experience_description = request.form['experience-description']
        with open('data/user_experiences.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\n")
        return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")
    return render_template('user_submission.html')
```

In the `login` function, ensure to handle the error message correctly:

```python
# Route for the login page
@app.route('/')
def login():
    return render_template('login.html', error=request.args.get('error'))
```

### Summary
By implementing the above changes, you will enhance the user experience by providing clear feedback when they attempt to submit an experience without being logged in. This is crucial for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction with the application.

'After reviewing the provided code and requirements, here are the findings based on the regulations set forth by ChatDev:\n\n### Regulation Compliance Check\n\n1. The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.\n   - Compliance: The Flask app is set to run on port 5000, so this regulation is met.\n\n2. The login page can be accessed directly via the route \'/\'. Please confirm whether the \'/\' route exists first.\n   - Compliance: The route for the login page is defined as @app.route(\'/\'), which is correct.\n\n3. The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.\n   - Compliance: All URLs in the frontend code use url_for() to reference the backend routes, which is correct.\n\n4. The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.\n   - Compliance: All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond to the frontend code.\n\n5. This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.\n   - Compliance: The code does not implement any password encryption, which is in line with this regulation.\n\n6. All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.\n   - Compliance: The code reads from the beginning of the files, so this regulation is met.\n\n7. Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.\n   - Compliance: All functions and URLs correspond correctly, with no discrepancies found.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment\n\nComment: The submit_experience function does not handle the case where the user is not logged in properly. If a user tries to submit their experience without being logged in, they are redirected to the login page, but the error message is not displayed. This could lead to confusion for the user.\n\nSuggestion for Revision:\nTo improve user experience, modify the submit_experience function to pass an error message back to the login page if the user is redirected due to not being logged in. Here’s how you can implement this:\n\npython\n# Route for the user submissions page\n@app.route(\'/submit_experience\', methods=[\'GET\', \'POST\'])\ndef submit_experience():\n    if \'username\' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in\n        return redirect(url_for(\'login\', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))\n    if request.method == \'POST\':\n        user_name = request.form[\'user-name\']\n        experience_description = request.form[\'experience-description\']\n        with open(\'data/user_experiences.txt\', \'a\') as f:\n            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\\n")\n        return render_template(\'user_submission.html\', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")\n    return render_template(\'user_submission.html\')\n\n\nIn the login function, ensure to handle the error message correctly:\n\npython\n# Route for the login page\n@app.route(\'/\')\ndef login():\n    return render_template(\'login.html\', error=request.args.get(\'error\'))\n\n\n### Summary\nBy implementing the above changes, you will enhance the user experience by providing clear feedback when they attempt to submit an experience without being logged in. This is crucial for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction with the application.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"After reviewing the provided code and requirements, here are the findings based on the regulations set forth by ChatDev:

### Regulation Compliance Check

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The Flask app is set to run on port 5000, so this regulation is met.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The route for the login page is defined as `@app.route('/')`, which is correct.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** All URLs in the frontend code use `url_for()` to reference the backend routes, which is correct.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** All necessary routes are defined in the backend code and correspond to the frontend code.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement any password encryption, which is in line with this regulation.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** The code reads from the beginning of the files, so this regulation is met.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** All functions and URLs correspond correctly, with no discrepancies found.

### Highest Priority Comment

**Comment:** The `submit_experience` function does not handle the case where the user is not logged in properly. If a user tries to submit their experience without being logged in, they are redirected to the login page, but the error message is not displayed. This could lead to confusion for the user.

**Suggestion for Revision:**
To improve user experience, modify the `submit_experience` function to pass an error message back to the login page if the user is redirected due to not being logged in. Here’s how you can implement this:

```python
# Route for the user submissions page
@app.route('/submit_experience', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit_experience():
    if 'username' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in
        return redirect(url_for('login', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_name = request.form['user-name']
        experience_description = request.form['experience-description']
        with open('data/user_experiences.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\n")
        return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")
    return render_template('user_submission.html')
```

In the `login` function, ensure to handle the error message correctly:

```python
# Route for the login page
@app.route('/')
def login():
    return render_template('login.html', error=request.args.get('error'))
```

### Summary
By implementing the above changes, you will enhance the user experience by providing clear feedback when they attempt to submit an experience without being logged in. This is crucial for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction with the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_access(self):

file name: app.py  
function name: login, festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  
detailed analysis of the problem: The test cases for the festival overview and details pages are failing due to the inability to locate specific elements by their IDs. This suggests that the pages may not be rendering correctly or that the IDs specified in the test cases do not match those in the HTML templates. For instance, the `festivals-list` ID may not be present in the rendered HTML of the festival overview page, and similarly, the `festival-title` ID may not be present in the festival details page. It is crucial to ensure that the HTML structure matches the expected IDs in the test cases and that the application is correctly navigating between pages.

file name: login.html  
function name: N/A  
detailed analysis of the problem: The login page seems to be functioning correctly as it is the entry point of the application. However, if the user is not successfully logged in, the subsequent pages will not load, leading to failures in locating elements on the festival overview and details pages. It is essential to verify that the login credentials used in the test cases are valid and that the application correctly sets the session for the logged-in user.

| **phase_prompt** | You are now a organization fine-tuner for the software development process.  Your task is to update the coding agent teams to ensure that the software requirements can be achieved. The overall requirements, current coding agent teams, and the issues in current implementation of the software are listed below:  Requirements: "{task}" Coding team composition: "{composition}". Coding team workflow: : "{workflow}". Source codes: "{codes}" Current issues: "{issues}". As the {assistant_role}, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase. The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks. COMPOSITION ``` Programmer 1: Task 1 description Programmer 2: Task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Programmer 1: [] Programmer 2: [Programmer 1] ``` Please note that: 1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file. 2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues: - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.  - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.  - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.  3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.  4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts.  5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks.  6) The workflow should not contain circles! |

Coding team composition: "{'Programmer 1': 'Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle the login logic. This includes creating a route for `/login` that processes the login form submission, checks the provided credentials against the `user_data.txt` file, and redirects the user to the festival overview page upon successful login. If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area. Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation. Address the issue where the login process may not be completing successfully, which prevents access to subsequent pages.', 'Programmer 2': 'Develop the frontend code for the festival overview page in `festival_overview.html`. This page should display a list of available cultural festivals and include a button to navigate to the user submissions page. Ensure that it correctly retrieves and displays the festival data from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.', 'Programmer 3': 'Develop the frontend code for the festival details page in `festival_details.html`. This page should display detailed information about the selected festival and allow users to leave comments. Ensure that it retrieves the festival details and existing comments from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`.

Current issues: "Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000. In this test, you only need to test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local 5000 port.
Error Summary: No error in codes.
Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task.
Error Summary: No error in codes.
Test the elements and integrity of ALL pages, ensuring that each page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document. This includes 
- Login Page  Check for the presence of `login-form`, `username`, `password`, `login-button`, and `error-message`.
- Festival Overview Page  Check for the presence of `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`.
- Festival Details Page  Check for the presence of `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`.
- User Submissions Page  Check for the presence of `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`.
Error Summary: file name: app.py  
function name: login, festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  
detailed analysis of the problem: The test cases for the festival overview and details pages are failing due to the inability to locate specific elements by their IDs. This suggests that the pages may not be rendering correctly or that the IDs specified in the test cases do not match those in the HTML templates. For instance, the `festivals-list` ID may not be present in the rendered HTML of the festival overview page, and similarly, the `festival-title` ID may not be present in the festival details page. It is crucial to ensure that the HTML structure matches the expected IDs in the test cases and that the application is correctly navigating between pages.

file name: login.html  
function name: N/A  
detailed analysis of the problem: The login page seems to be functioning correctly as it is the entry point of the application. However, if the user is not successfully logged in, the subsequent pages will not load, leading to failures in locating elements on the festival overview and details pages. It is essential to verify that the login credentials used in the test cases are valid and that the application correctly sets the session for the logged-in user.
".

As the Programmer, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase.

The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks.

### COMPOSITION

```

Programmer 1: Task 1 description

Programmer 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Programmer 1: []

Programmer 2: [Programmer 1]

```

Please note that:

1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file.

2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues:

    - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.

    - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.

    - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task. 

4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts. 

5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks. 

6) The workflow should not contain circles!

### COMPOSITION

```
Programmer 1: Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle the login logic. This includes creating a route for `/login` that processes the login form submission, checks the provided credentials against the `user_data.txt` file, and redirects the user to the festival overview page upon successful login. If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area. Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation. Address the issue where the login process may not be completing successfully, which prevents access to subsequent pages.

Programmer 2: Develop the frontend code for the festival overview page in `festival_overview.html`. This page should display a list of available cultural festivals and include a button to navigate to the user submissions page. Ensure that it correctly retrieves and displays the festival data from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.

Programmer 3: Develop the frontend code for the festival details page in `festival_details.html`. This page should display detailed information about the selected festival and allow users to leave comments. Ensure that it retrieves the festival details and existing comments from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.

Programmer 4: Develop the frontend code for the user submissions page in `user_submission.html`. This page should include a form for users to submit their experiences and display a success message upon submission. Ensure that it correctly processes the submission and provides feedback to the user. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 
Task: "".
Modality: "website".
Programming Language: "Python and HTML"
Sub-Task description: "Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle the login logic. This includes creating a route for `/login` that processes the login form submission, checks the provided credentials against the `user_data.txt` file, and redirects the user to the festival overview page upon successful login. If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area. Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation. Address the issue where the login process may not be completing successfully, which prevents access to subsequent pages."

If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes: "{codes}" As the {assistant_role}, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations: 1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000. 2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first. 3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names. 4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code. 5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password. 6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file. 7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision.

1. **User Data (user_data.txt)**
   - Format: `username,password`
   - Example:
     ```
     john_doe,password123
     jane_smith,securepass456
     ```

2. **Festival Data (festival_data.txt)**
   - Format: `festival_name;festival_description;date;category;performers`
   - Example:
     ```
     Diwali Festival;An annual celebration of lights;2023-11-12;Cultural;Various Artists

     jane_smith;The Holi Celebration brought back so many memories.
     ```

Files will be stored in the following directory structure:
```
data/
  ├── user_data.txt
  ├── festival_data.txt
  ├── comments.txt
  └── user_experiences.txt
```

This document outlines the essential requirements for the web application, ensuring clarity for development and future testing..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

After reviewing the provided code and requirements, here are the findings based on the regulations set by ChatDev:

1. **Route for the Login Page (`/`)**: 
   - The route for the login page exists and is correctly defined in the backend code as `@app.route('/')`. This complies with the requirement.

2. **Frontend URLs**: 
   - The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for` function to generate URLs, which is compliant with the requirement to use routing rather than local HTML file names.

3. **Backend Routes**: 
   - The backend code establishes routes for each page, and they correspond correctly to those used in the frontend code. This is compliant.

4. **Password Encryption**: 
   - The code does not implement password encryption, which is compliant with the requirement since it is stated that encryption is not necessary for this example.

5. **Data File Read Operations**: 
   - All data file read operations start from the first line of the data file, which is compliant.

6. **Function and URL Correspondence**: 
   - The functions and URLs in both the frontend and backend code correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. This is compliant.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment**: The `app.secret_key` is currently hardcoded as `'your_secret_key'`. While this is acceptable for development purposes, it poses a security risk if the application is deployed without changing this key. 

**Suggestion for Revision**:
- Change the hardcoded secret key to use an environment variable. This can be done using Python's `os` module to load the secret key from an environment variable. This way, the secret key can be kept secure and not exposed in the source code.

### Instructions to Fix:
1. Import the `os` module at the beginning of your `app.py` file:
   ```python
   import os
   ```

2. Modify the `app.secret_key` line to retrieve the secret key from an environment variable:
   ```python
   app.secret_key = os.getenv('FLASK_SECRET_KEY', 'default_secret_key')  # Use a default for development
   ```

3. Set the environment variable `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` in your development environment. For example, in a Unix-based system, you can set it in the terminal before running the application:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_SECRET_KEY='your_secure_secret_key'
   ```

By implementing this change, you enhance the security of your application while maintaining compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

 After reviewing the provided code and requirements, here are the findings based on the regulations set by ChatDev:

1. **Route for the Login Page (`/`)**: 
   - The route for the login page exists and is correctly defined in the backend code as `@app.route('/')`. This complies with the requirement.

2. **Frontend URLs**: 
   - The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for` function to generate URLs, which is compliant with the requirement to use routing rather than local HTML file names.

3. **Backend Routes**: 
   - The backend code establishes routes for each page, and they correspond correctly to those used in the frontend code. This is compliant.

4. **Password Encryption**: 
   - The code does not implement password encryption, which is compliant with the requirement since it is stated that encryption is not necessary for this example.

5. **Data File Read Operations**: 
   - All data file read operations start from the first line of the data file, which is compliant.

6. **Function and URL Correspondence**: 
   - The functions and URLs in both the frontend and backend code correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. This is compliant.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment**: The `app.secret_key` is currently hardcoded as `'your_secret_key'`. While this is acceptable for development purposes, it poses a security risk if the application is deployed without changing this key. 

**Suggestion for Revision**:
- Change the hardcoded secret key to use an environment variable. This can be done using Python's `os` module to load the secret key from an environment variable. This way, the secret key can be kept secure and not exposed in the source code.

### Instructions to Fix:
1. Import the `os` module at the beginning of your `app.py` file:
   ```python
   import os
   ```

2. Modify the `app.secret_key` line to retrieve the secret key from an environment variable:
   ```python
   app.secret_key = os.getenv('FLASK_SECRET_KEY', 'default_secret_key')  # Use a default for development
   ```

3. Set the environment variable `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` in your development environment. For example, in a Unix-based system, you can set it in the terminal before running the application:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_SECRET_KEY='your_secure_secret_key'
   ```

By implementing this change, you enhance the security of your application while maintaining compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev.

Import the os module at the beginning of your app.py file:\n   python\n   import os\n\n\n2. Modify the app.secret_key line to retrieve the secret key from an environment variable:\n   python\n   app.secret_key = os.getenv('FLASK_SECRET_KEY', 'default_secret_key')  # Use a default for development\n\n\n3. Set the environment variable FLASK_SECRET_KEY in your development environment. For example, in a Unix-based system, you can set it in the terminal before running the application:\n   bash\n   export FLASK_SECRET_KEY='your_secure_secret_key'\n\n\nBy implementing this change, you enhance the security of your application while maintaining compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev."} |

Comments on Codes:
"After reviewing the provided code and requirements, here are the findings based on the regulations set by ChatDev:

1. **Route for the Login Page (`/`)**: 
   - The route for the login page exists and is correctly defined in the backend code as `@app.route('/')`. This complies with the requirement.

2. **Frontend URLs**: 
   - The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for` function to generate URLs, which is compliant with the requirement to use routing rather than local HTML file names.

3. **Backend Routes**: 
   - The backend code establishes routes for each page, and they correspond correctly to those used in the frontend code. This is compliant.

4. **Password Encryption**: 
   - The code does not implement password encryption, which is compliant with the requirement since it is stated that encryption is not necessary for this example.

5. **Data File Read Operations**: 
   - All data file read operations start from the first line of the data file, which is compliant.

6. **Function and URL Correspondence**: 
   - The functions and URLs in both the frontend and backend code correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. This is compliant.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment**: The `app.secret_key` is currently hardcoded as `'your_secret_key'`. While this is acceptable for development purposes, it poses a security risk if the application is deployed without changing this key. 

**Suggestion for Revision**:
- Change the hardcoded secret key to use an environment variable. This can be done using Python's `os` module to load the secret key from an environment variable. This way, the secret key can be kept secure and not exposed in the source code.

### Instructions to Fix:
1. Import the `os` module at the beginning of your `app.py` file:
   ```python
   import os
   ```

2. Modify the `app.secret_key` line to retrieve the secret key from an environment variable:
   ```python
   app.secret_key = os.getenv('FLASK_SECRET_KEY', 'default_secret_key')  # Use a default for development
   ```

3. Set the environment variable `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` in your development environment. For example, in a Unix-based system, you can set it in the terminal before running the application:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_SECRET_KEY='your_secure_secret_key'
   ```

By implementing this change, you enhance the security of your application while maintaining compliance with the regulations set forth by ChatDev."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

Here is the implementation of the test case for the login page access through local port 5000, following the specified format:

test_requirement_1.py
```python
'''
Test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local port 5000.
'''
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class TestLoginPageAccess(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_access(self):
        driver = self.driver
        time.sleep(2)  # Wait for the page to load
        try:
            # Check if the login form is present
            login_form = driver.find_element(By.ID, "login-form")
            self.assertIsNotNone(login_form, "Login form is not found on the page.")
            print("Login page accessed successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Failed to access login page: {str(e)}")

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### Explanation:
- The test case is structured to check if the login page can be accessed via the specified local port.
- The `setUp` method initializes the Chrome WebDriver and navigates to `http://localhost:5000`.
- The `test_login_page_access` method checks for the presence of the login form by looking for the element with the ID `login-form`. If found, it confirms successful access; if not, it raises an assertion failure.
- The `tearDown` method ensures that the browser is closed after the test completes.
- The test uses `unittest` framework for structured testing and logging.

Testing Task description: "Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task."
According to Testing Task description, please write test cases to locate the bugs, note that logging is important, ensure the content and format is right. 
You should first locate the functions that need to be tested and write the test cases for them according to the testing task description.
The output must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is "test_requirement_2.py", "LANGUAGE" in the programming language,"REQUIREMENTS" is the targeted requirement of the test case, and "CODE" is the test code that is used to test the specific requirement of the file. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
REQUIREMENTS
'''
CODE
```
You will implement the "test_requirement_2.py" and finish it follows in the strictly defined format.
Please note that:
1. Please adhere strictly to the Testing Task description to develop unit test code for the web application using Python, Selenium, and unittest framework. 
2. The test code needs to be directly executable and only need to cover the tests required by the Testing Task description.
3. Chrome WebDriver is already installed and the path is in the environment variable, so there is no need to specify its path in the test code. And 'WebDriver' object has no attribute 'find_element_by_id'
4. Access to the login page is available at http://localhost:5000. Navigation is restricted to http://localhost:5000 exclusively via the driver.get() method; navigation to other URLs is not allowed.
5. You must utilize the username and password from Data Storage to construct a login method within the test class. 
6. Access to All pages, except for the login and registration pages, requires logging in from the login page and then proceeding by clicking the corresponding buttons on the page to navigate to the desired page.
7. After logging in, you will be redirected to other pages and will not stay on the login page.

file name: app.py  
function name: login, festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  
detailed analysis of the problem: The test cases for the festival overview and details pages are failing due to the inability to locate specific elements by their IDs. This could be caused by the pages not being rendered correctly or the elements not being present at the time the tests are executed. The login function may not be successfully redirecting to the festival overview page, which would explain why the elements on that page cannot be found. Additionally, if the user is not logged in successfully, the subsequent pages will not load as expected, leading to the errors observed in the test results. 

file name: login.html  
function name: None  
detailed analysis of the problem: The login page appears to be functioning correctly as per the source code. However, if the login credentials are incorrect or if the session is not being maintained properly, it could lead to the user not being redirected to the festival overview page. This would result in the test cases failing to find the required elements on the festival overview and details pages. The error messages indicate that the elements are not found, which suggests that the login process may not be completing successfully.

| **phase_prompt** | You are now a organization fine-tuner for the software development process.  Your task is to update the coding agent teams to ensure that the software requirements can be achieved. The overall requirements, current coding agent teams, and the issues in current implementation of the software are listed below:  Requirements: "{task}" Coding team composition: "{composition}". Coding team workflow: : "{workflow}". Source codes: "{codes}" Current issues: "{issues}". As the {assistant_role}, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase. The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks. COMPOSITION ``` Programmer 1: Task 1 description Programmer 2: Task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Programmer 1: [] Programmer 2: [Programmer 1] ``` Please note that: 1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file. 2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues: - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.  - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.  - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.  3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.  4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts.  5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks.  6) The workflow should not contain circles! |

If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area. Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation. Address the issue where the login process may not be completing successfully, which prevents access to subsequent pages.', 'Programmer 2': 'Develop the frontend code for the festival overview page in `festival_overview.html`. This page should display a list of available cultural festivals and include a button to navigate to the user submissions page. Ensure that it correctly retrieves and displays the festival data from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.', 'Programmer 3': 'Develop the frontend code for the festival details page in `festival_details.html`.

Current issues: "Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000. In this test, you only need to test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local 5000 port.
Error Summary: No error in codes.
Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task.
Error Summary: No error in codes.
Test the elements and integrity of ALL pages, ensuring that each page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document. This includes 
- Login Page  Check for the presence of `login-form`, `username`, `password`, `login-button`, and `error-message`.
- Festival Overview Page  Check for the presence of `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`.
- Festival Details Page  Check for the presence of `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`.
- User Submissions Page  Check for the presence of `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`.
Error Summary: file name: app.py  
function name: login, festival_overview, festival_details, submit_experience  
detailed analysis of the problem: The test cases for the festival overview and details pages are failing due to the inability to locate specific elements by their IDs. This could be caused by the pages not being rendered correctly or the elements not being present at the time the tests are executed. The login function may not be successfully redirecting to the festival overview page, which would explain why the elements on that page cannot be found. Additionally, if the user is not logged in successfully, the subsequent pages will not load as expected, leading to the errors observed in the test results. 

file name: login.html  
function name: None  
detailed analysis of the problem: The login page appears to be functioning correctly as per the source code. However, if the login credentials are incorrect or if the session is not being maintained properly, it could lead to the user not being redirected to the festival overview page. This would result in the test cases failing to find the required elements on the festival overview and details pages. The error messages indicate that the elements are not found, which suggests that the login process may not be completing successfully.
".

As the Programmer, you should first think step by step to update the composition of subtasks based on the Task, previous workflow, and error summaries of testcase.

The updated coding agent team should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of programmers' tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between programmers' tasks.

### COMPOSITION

```

Programmer 1: Task 1 description

Programmer 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Programmer 1: []

Programmer 2: [Programmer 1]

```

Please note that:

1) Each programmer should complete one subtask, and each subtask is responsible for completing one code file.

2) According to the original Task description, source code, and current issues:

    - Programmers who need to improve their code file will be retained in this workflow, and their subtask is to fix issues with the code files they are responsible for. In his subtask description, it is necessary to specify his tasks in detail.

    - If a code file has no issues based current issue, DELETE this subtask and its programmer.

    - According to the original Task, if there is a missing code file in the source code, please add a new programmer responsible for implementing the code file.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task. 

4) Each programmer is unaware of their peers' tasks, hence the description of each task should be thorough. If a task involves collaboration with other programmers, it is essential to first clarify the responsibilities of the other programmers and specify how one's own task should be coordinated to complement their efforts. 

5) If there is an issue with the code file that the programmer is responsible for, please clearly state the issue and modification plan in its subtasks. 

6) The workflow should not contain circles!

### COMPOSITION

```
Programmer 1: Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle the login logic. This includes creating a route for `/login` that processes the login form submission, checks the provided credentials against the `user_data.txt` file, and redirects the user to the festival overview page upon successful login. If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area. Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation. Address the issue where the login process may not be completing successfully, which prevents access to subsequent pages.

Programmer 2: Develop the frontend code for the festival overview page in `festival_overview.html`. This page should display a list of available cultural festivals and include a button to navigate to the user submissions page. Ensure that it correctly retrieves and displays the festival data from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festivals-list`, `festival_item_<index>` for each festival, and `submit-experience-button`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.

Programmer 3: Develop the frontend code for the festival details page in `festival_details.html`. This page should display detailed information about the selected festival and allow users to leave comments. Ensure that it retrieves the festival details and existing comments from the backend. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `festival-title`, `festival-info`, `comments-section`, `comment-name`, `comment-input`, `submit-comment-button`, and `back-button`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.

Programmer 4: Develop the frontend code for the user submissions page in `user_submission.html`. This page should include a form for users to submit their experiences and display a success message upon submission. Ensure that it correctly processes the submission and provides feedback to the user. Confirm that the page contains the required elements as specified in the requirements document, including `submission-form`, `user-name`, `experience-description`, `submit-button`, and `success-message`. Address the issue where elements are not being found due to potential login failures.
```

If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format: FILENAME LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE |

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 
Task: "".
Modality: "website".
Programming Language: "Python and HTML"
Sub-Task description: "Implement the backend code in `app.py` to handle the login logic. This includes creating a route for `/login` that processes the login form submission, checks the provided credentials against the `user_data.txt` file, and redirects the user to the festival overview page upon successful login. If the login fails, it should return to the login page with an appropriate error message displayed in the `error-message` area. Additionally, ensure that the login process is correctly integrated with the festival overview and details pages to facilitate smooth navigation. Address the issue where the login process may not be completing successfully, which prevents access to subsequent pages."

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format: FILENAME LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE |

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes: "{codes}" As the {assistant_role}, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations: 1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000. 2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first. 3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names. 4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code. 5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password. 6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file. 7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. |

"
As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision.

Files will be stored in the following directory structure:
```
data/
  ├── user_data.txt
  ├── festival_data.txt
  ├── comments.txt
  └── user_experiences.txt
```

This document outlines the essential requirements for the web application, ensuring clarity for development and future testing..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code and requirements, I have checked the regulations one by one. Here are my findings:

1. **Accessing the website at http://localhost:5000**: The application is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.

2. **Checking the existence of the '/' route**: The route for the login page (`'/'`) is implemented correctly in the `app.py` file with the `login()` function.

3. **Frontend URLs provided through routing**: The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for()` function to generate URLs, which is compliant with the requirement.

4. **Backend routes for each page**: The backend code establishes routes for each page, and they correspond correctly to the frontend code.

5. **No need for encrypted passwords**: The code does not implement password encryption, which is compliant with the requirement.

6. **Data file read operations starting from the first line**: The code reads from the data files starting from the first line, which is compliant.

7. **Correspondence of functions and URLs**: The functions and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment**: The `submit_experience` function does not validate the user input before writing to the `user_experiences.txt` file. This could lead to issues if the input is not properly formatted or contains unexpected characters.

**Suggestion for Revision**:
To enhance the robustness of the application, you should implement input validation in the `submit_experience` function. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Add Input Validation**: Before writing to the file, check if the `user_name` and `experience_description` are not empty and do not contain any invalid characters.

2. **Example Code for Input Validation**:
```python
import re

@app.route('/submit_experience', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit_experience():
    if 'username' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in
        return redirect(url_for('login', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_name = request.form['user-name']
        experience_description = request.form['experience-description']
        
        # Input validation
        if not user_name or not experience_description:
            return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Please fill in all fields.")
        
        if not re.match("^[A-Za-z0-9_ ]*$", user_name):  # Allow only alphanumeric characters and underscores
            return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Invalid username format.")
        
        with open('data/user_experiences.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\n")
        return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")
    return render_template('user_submission.html')
```

### Instructions on Fixing:
1. Implement the input validation as shown above in the `submit_experience` function.
2. Test the application to ensure that it handles invalid input gracefully and provides appropriate feedback to the user.

By making these changes, you will improve the robustness of the application and ensure that user inputs are properly validated before being stored.

'Upon reviewing the provided code and requirements, I have checked the regulations one by one. Here are my findings:\n\n1. Accessing the website at http://localhost:5000: The application is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.\n\n2. Checking the existence of the \'/\' route: The route for the login page (\'/\') is implemented correctly in the app.py file with the login() function.\n\n3. Frontend URLs provided through routing: The frontend code uses Flask\'s url_for() function to generate URLs, which is compliant with the requirement.\n\n4. Backend routes for each page: The backend code establishes routes for each page, and they correspond correctly to the frontend code.\n\n5. No need for encrypted passwords: The code does not implement password encryption, which is compliant with the requirement.\n\n6. Data file read operations starting from the first line: The code reads from the data files starting from the first line, which is compliant.\n\n7. Correspondence of functions and URLs: The functions and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nComment: The submit_experience function does not validate the user input before writing to the user_experiences.txt file. This could lead to issues if the input is not properly formatted or contains unexpected characters.\n\nSuggestion for Revision:\nTo enhance the robustness of the application, you should implement input validation in the submit_experience function. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. Add Input Validation: Before writing to the file, check if the user_name and experience_description are not empty and do not contain any invalid characters.\n\n2. Example Code for Input Validation:\npython\nimport re\n\n@app.route(\'/submit_experience\', methods=[\'GET\', \'POST\'])\ndef submit_experience():\n    if \'username\' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in\n        return redirect(url_for(\'login\', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))\n    if request.method == \'POST\':\n        user_name = request.form[\'user-name\']\n        experience_description = request.form[\'experience-description\']\n        \n        # Input validation\n        if not user_name or not experience_description:\n            return render_template(\'user_submission.html\', success_message="Please fill in all fields.")\n        \n        if not re.match("^[A-Za-z0-9_ ]*$", user_name):  # Allow only alphanumeric characters and underscores\n            return render_template(\'user_submission.html\', success_message="Invalid username format.")\n        \n        with open(\'data/user_experiences.txt\', \'a\') as f:\n            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\\n")\n        return render_template(\'user_submission.html\', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")\n    return render_template(\'user_submission.html\')\n\n\n### Instructions on Fixing:\n1. Implement the input validation as shown above in the submit_experience function.\n2. Test the application to ensure that it handles invalid input gracefully and provides appropriate feedback to the user.\n\nBy making these changes, you will improve the robustness of the application and ensure that user inputs are properly validated before being stored.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code and requirements, I have checked the regulations one by one. Here are my findings:

1. **Accessing the website at http://localhost:5000**: The application is set to run on port 5000, which is correct.

2. **Checking the existence of the '/' route**: The route for the login page (`'/'`) is implemented correctly in the `app.py` file with the `login()` function.

3. **Frontend URLs provided through routing**: The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for()` function to generate URLs, which is compliant with the requirement.

4. **Backend routes for each page**: The backend code establishes routes for each page, and they correspond correctly to the frontend code.

5. **No need for encrypted passwords**: The code does not implement password encryption, which is compliant with the requirement.

6. **Data file read operations starting from the first line**: The code reads from the data files starting from the first line, which is compliant.

7. **Correspondence of functions and URLs**: The functions and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Comment**: The `submit_experience` function does not validate the user input before writing to the `user_experiences.txt` file. This could lead to issues if the input is not properly formatted or contains unexpected characters.

**Suggestion for Revision**:
To enhance the robustness of the application, you should implement input validation in the `submit_experience` function. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Add Input Validation**: Before writing to the file, check if the `user_name` and `experience_description` are not empty and do not contain any invalid characters.

2. **Example Code for Input Validation**:
```python
import re

@app.route('/submit_experience', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def submit_experience():
    if 'username' not in session:  # Check if user is logged in
        return redirect(url_for('login', error="You must be logged in to submit your experience."))
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_name = request.form['user-name']
        experience_description = request.form['experience-description']
        
        # Input validation
        if not user_name or not experience_description:
            return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Please fill in all fields.")
        
        if not re.match("^[A-Za-z0-9_ ]*$", user_name):  # Allow only alphanumeric characters and underscores
            return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Invalid username format.")
        
        with open('data/user_experiences.txt', 'a') as f:
            f.write(f"{user_name};{experience_description}\n")
        return render_template('user_submission.html', success_message="Experience submitted successfully!")
    return render_template('user_submission.html')
```

### Instructions on Fixing:
1. Implement the input validation as shown above in the `submit_experience` function.
2. Test the application to ensure that it handles invalid input gracefully and provides appropriate feedback to the user.

By making these changes, you will improve the robustness of the application and ensure that user inputs are properly validated before being stored."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.
