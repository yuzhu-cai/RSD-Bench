### Data Format
The data will be stored in plain text format, where each journal entry will consist of the title, date, and content structured in the following way:
```
[Entry Title]|[Journal Entry Content]
```

### Data Examples
1. **File:** `data/journal_entries.txt`
```
My First Day|Today was a great day. I started my new job!
Weekend Adventures|Went hiking with friends this weekend. Beautiful weather!
```
2. **File:** `data/user_credentials.txt`
```
user1|password123
user2|mypassword
```
### File Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **File:** `journal_entries.txt` (for storing all journal entries)
  - **File:** `user_credentials.txt` (optional, for storing user information if needed)

This structure ensures that entries are easily readable and maintainable while allowing the web application to adequately function without the need for a SQL database.

### Data Format
The data will be stored in plain text format, where each journal entry will consist of the title, date, and content structured in the following way:
```
[Entry Title]|[Journal Entry Content]
```

### Data Examples
1. **File:** `data/journal_entries.txt`
```
My First Day|Today was a great day. I started my new job!
Weekend Adventures|Went hiking with friends this weekend. Beautiful weather!
```
2. **File:** `data/user_credentials.txt`
```
user1|password123
user2|mypassword
```
### File Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **File:** `journal_entries.txt` (for storing all journal entries)
  - **File:** `user_credentials.txt` (optional, for storing user information if needed)

This structure ensures that entries are easily readable and maintainable while allowing the web application to adequately function without the need for a SQL database..

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Task description: "{description}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas:"{ideas}" Requirements:"{requirements}" Coding plan: "{codes}" Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to decompose the overall coding plans into smaller tasks and assign them to different programmers. The decomposition should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks.  COMPOSITION ``` Task 1: Task 1 description Task 2: Task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Task 1: [] Task 2: [Task 1] ``` Please note that the decomposition should be both effective and efficient. 1) According to the Coding plan, each decomposed task should only be responsible for implementing one code file mentioned in Coding Plan. 2) Data files do not need to be assigned to programmers for implementation. 3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task. 4) The first subtask should implement the backend code, while the REMAINING SUBTASKS should develop the frontend code based on backend codes. 5) Each code file should be assigned only one subtask; multiple subtasks for a single code file are not necessary. 6) If the subtask is to complete the frontend code, it should be explicitly noted in the subtask that all URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names. 7) If the subtask is to complete the backend code, it should include the following clear descriptions: - The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'.  - The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code.  - File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text.  In addition to these descriptions, the subtask should list all frontend code files and incorporate the original task's supplementary condition. 8) The workflow should not contain circles! |

The decomposition should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks. 

### COMPOSITION

```

Task 1: Task 1 description

Task 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Task 1: []

Task 2: [Task 1]

```

Please note that the decomposition should be both effective and efficient.

1) According to the Coding plan, each decomposed task should only be responsible for implementing one code file mentioned in Coding Plan.

2) Data files do not need to be assigned to programmers for implementation.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.

4) The first subtask should implement the backend code, while the REMAINING SUBTASKS should develop the frontend code based on backend codes.

5) Each code file should be assigned only one subtask; multiple subtasks for a single code file are not necessary.

6) If the subtask is to complete the frontend code, it should be explicitly noted in the subtask that all URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names.

7) If the subtask is to complete the backend code, it should include the following clear descriptions:

    - The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'.

    - The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code.

    - File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text.

In addition to these descriptions, the subtask should list all frontend code files and incorporate the original task's supplementary condition.

8) The workflow should not contain circles!

If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

## 4. Data Storage

Data for the Daily Journal App will be stored in the local text files located in the directory `data`. Different types of data will be managed using separate text files as follows:

### Data Format
The data will be stored in plain text format, where each journal entry will consist of the title, date, and content structured in the following way:
```
[Entry Title]|[Journal Entry Content]
```

### Data Examples
1. **File:** `data/journal_entries.txt`
```
My First Day|Today was a great day. I started my new job!
Weekend Adventures|Went hiking with friends this weekend. Beautiful weather!
```
2. **File:** `data/user_credentials.txt`
```
user1|password123
user2|mypassword
```
### File Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **File:** `journal_entries.txt` (for storing all journal entries)
  - **File:** `user_credentials.txt` (optional, for storing user information if needed)

This structure ensures that entries are easily readable and maintainable while allowing the web application to adequately function without the need for a SQL database..

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

## 4. Data Storage

Data for the Daily Journal App will be stored in the local text files located in the directory `data`. Different types of data will be managed using separate text files as follows:

### Data Format
The data will be stored in plain text format, where each journal entry will consist of the title, date, and content structured in the following way:
```
[Entry Title]|[Journal Entry Content]
```

### Data Examples
1. **File:** `data/journal_entries.txt`
```
My First Day|Today was a great day. I started my new job!
Weekend Adventures|Went hiking with friends this weekend. Beautiful weather!
```
2. **File:** `data/user_credentials.txt`
```
user1|password123
user2|mypassword
```
### File Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **File:** `journal_entries.txt` (for storing all journal entries)
  - **File:** `user_credentials.txt` (optional, for storing user information if needed)

This structure ensures that entries are easily readable and maintainable while allowing the web application to adequately function without the need for a SQL database..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

## 4. Data Storage

Data for the Daily Journal App will be stored in the local text files located in the directory `data`. Different types of data will be managed using separate text files as follows:

### Data Format
The data will be stored in plain text format, where each journal entry will consist of the title, date, and content structured in the following way:
```
[Entry Title]|[Journal Entry Content]
```

### Data Examples
1. **File:** `data/journal_entries.txt`
```
My First Day|Today was a great day. I started my new job!
Weekend Adventures|Went hiking with friends this weekend. Beautiful weather!
```
2. **File:** `data/user_credentials.txt`
```
user1|password123
user2|mypassword
```
### File Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **File:** `journal_entries.txt` (for storing all journal entries)
  - **File:** `user_credentials.txt` (optional, for storing user information if needed)

This structure ensures that entries are easily readable and maintainable while allowing the web application to adequately function without the need for a SQL database..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

## 4. Data Storage

Data for the Daily Journal App will be stored in the local text files located in the directory `data`. Different types of data will be managed using separate text files as follows:

### Data Format
The data will be stored in plain text format, where each journal entry will consist of the title, date, and content structured in the following way:
```
[Entry Title]|[Journal Entry Content]
```

### Data Examples
1. **File:** `data/journal_entries.txt`
```
My First Day|Today was a great day. I started my new job!
Weekend Adventures|Went hiking with friends this weekend. Beautiful weather!
```
2. **File:** `data/user_credentials.txt`
```
user1|password123
user2|mypassword
```
### File Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **File:** `journal_entries.txt` (for storing all journal entries)
  - **File:** `user_credentials.txt` (optional, for storing user information if needed)

This structure ensures that entries are easily readable and maintainable while allowing the web application to adequately function without the need for a SQL database..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes: "{codes}" As the {assistant_role}, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations: 1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000. 2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first. 3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names. 4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code. 5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password. 6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file. 7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. |

"
As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision.

## 4. Data Storage

Data for the Daily Journal App will be stored in the local text files located in the directory `data`. Different types of data will be managed using separate text files as follows:

### Data Format
The data will be stored in plain text format, where each journal entry will consist of the title, date, and content structured in the following way:
```
[Entry Title]|[Journal Entry Content]
```

### Data Examples
1. **File:** `data/journal_entries.txt`
```
My First Day|Today was a great day. I started my new job!
Weekend Adventures|Went hiking with friends this weekend. Beautiful weather!
```
2. **File:** `data/user_credentials.txt`
```
user1|password123
user2|mypassword
```
### File Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **File:** `journal_entries.txt` (for storing all journal entries)
  - **File:** `user_credentials.txt` (optional, for storing user information if needed)

This structure ensures that entries are easily readable and maintainable while allowing the web application to adequately function without the need for a SQL database..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed immediately.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Issue with User Authentication Logic:**
The current implementation does not handle the case where a user tries to register with a username that already exists. This could lead to duplicate entries in the `user_credentials.txt` file, which would cause confusion during the login process.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Check for Existing Username During Registration:**
   Before writing new user credentials to the file, you should check if the username already exists in the `user_credentials.txt` file. If it does, you should inform the user that the username is taken and prompt them to choose a different one.

### Code Implementation:
You can modify the `register` function in `app.py` as follows:

```python
@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    '''Handle user registration.'''
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['reg_username_input']
        password = request.form['reg_password_input']
        
        # Check if the username already exists
        credentials = read_user_credentials()
        if username in credentials:
            return render_template('register.html', error="Username already exists. Please choose a different one.")
        
        write_user_credentials(username, password)
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
    return render_template('register.html')
```

### Update `register.html`:
You should also update the `register.html` template to display an error message if the username already exists. Add the following code snippet to the `register.html` file:

```html
{% if error %}
    <p style="color: red;">{{ error }}</p>
{% endif %}
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added a check for existing usernames in the registration process.
- Provided feedback to the user if the username is already taken.
- Updated the registration page to display error messages.

By implementing these changes, you will enhance the user experience and ensure that the application behaves correctly during the registration process. Please proceed with these revisions to ensure compliance with the regulations and improve the application's functionality.

This could lead to duplicate entries in the user_credentials.txt file, which would cause confusion during the login process.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. Check for Existing Username During Registration:\n   Before writing new user credentials to the file, you should check if the username already exists in the user_credentials.txt file. If it does, you should inform the user that the username is taken and prompt them to choose a different one.\n\n### Code Implementation:\nYou can modify the register function in app.py as follows:\n\npython\n@app.route(\'/register\', methods=[\'GET\', \'POST\'])\ndef register():\n    \'\'\'Handle user registration.\'\'\'\n    if request.method == \'POST\':\n        username = request.form[\'reg_username_input\']\n        password = request.form[\'reg_password_input\']\n        \n        # Check if the username already exists\n        credentials = read_user_credentials()\n        if username in credentials:\n            return render_template(\'register.html\', error="Username already exists. Please choose a different one.")\n        \n        write_user_credentials(username, password)\n        return redirect(url_for(\'login\'))\n    return render_template(\'register.html\')\n\n\n### Update register.html:\nYou should also update the register.html template to display an error message if the username already exists. Add the following code snippet to the register.html file:\n\nhtml\n{% if error %}\n    &lt;p style="color: red;"&gt;{{ error }}&lt;/p&gt;\n{% endif %}\n\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n- Added a check for existing usernames in the registration process.\n- Provided feedback to the user if the username is already taken.\n- Updated the registration page to display error messages.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will enhance the user experience and ensure that the application behaves correctly during the registration process. Please proceed with these revisions to ensure compliance with the regulations and improve the application\'s functionality.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified a critical issue that needs to be addressed immediately.

### Highest Priority Comment:
**Issue with User Authentication Logic:**
The current implementation does not handle the case where a user tries to register with a username that already exists. This could lead to duplicate entries in the `user_credentials.txt` file, which would cause confusion during the login process.

### Suggested Revision:
1. **Check for Existing Username During Registration:**
   Before writing new user credentials to the file, you should check if the username already exists in the `user_credentials.txt` file. If it does, you should inform the user that the username is taken and prompt them to choose a different one.

### Code Implementation:
You can modify the `register` function in `app.py` as follows:

```python
@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    '''Handle user registration.'''
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['reg_username_input']
        password = request.form['reg_password_input']
        
        # Check if the username already exists
        credentials = read_user_credentials()
        if username in credentials:
            return render_template('register.html', error="Username already exists. Please choose a different one.")
        
        write_user_credentials(username, password)
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
    return render_template('register.html')
```

### Update `register.html`:
You should also update the `register.html` template to display an error message if the username already exists. Add the following code snippet to the `register.html` file:

```html
{% if error %}
    <p style="color: red;">{{ error }}</p>
{% endif %}
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added a check for existing usernames in the registration process.
- Provided feedback to the user if the username is already taken.
- Updated the registration page to display error messages.

By implementing these changes, you will enhance the user experience and ensure that the application behaves correctly during the registration process. Please proceed with these revisions to ensure compliance with the regulations and improve the application's functionality."

## 4. Data Storage

Data for the Daily Journal App will be stored in the local text files located in the directory `data`. Different types of data will be managed using separate text files as follows:

### Data Format
The data will be stored in plain text format, where each journal entry will consist of the title, date, and content structured in the following way:
```
[Entry Title]|[Journal Entry Content]
```

### Data Examples
1. **File:** `data/journal_entries.txt`
```
My First Day|Today was a great day. I started my new job!
Weekend Adventures|Went hiking with friends this weekend. Beautiful weather!
```
2. **File:** `data/user_credentials.txt`
```
user1|password123
user2|mypassword
```
### File Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **File:** `journal_entries.txt` (for storing all journal entries)
  - **File:** `user_credentials.txt` (optional, for storing user information if needed)

This structure ensures that entries are easily readable and maintainable while allowing the web application to adequately function without the need for a SQL database..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here are the modified codes with the necessary changes implemented according to the comments provided. Each file is formatted as specified.

| **phase_prompt** | According to the software requirements listed below:  Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Your goal is to organize a testing team to complete the software development task. There are two default testing tasks:  1) Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000. In this test, you only need to test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local 5000 port. 2) Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task. In addition, there are other testing tasks as well: You need to assign ONE testing task to test the elements and integrity of ALL pages. In order to write testing code, you need to clearly describe the elements that need to be included in each page in this testing task, taking into account the original task requirements. Follow the format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of testing tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks.  COMPOSITION ``` Task 1: Testing task 1 description Task 2: Testing task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Task 1: [] Task 2: [Task 1] ``` Please note that:  1) the format of your answer must strictly comply with the above form. Your description of the testing task must be in "COMPOSITION"; 2) you don't need to modify the description of the default testing task. |

Your goal is to organize a testing team to complete the software development task.

There are two default testing tasks: 

1) Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000. In this test, you only need to test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local 5000 port.

2) Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task.

In addition, there are other testing tasks as well:

You need to assign ONE testing task to test the elements and integrity of ALL pages.

In order to write testing code, you need to clearly describe the elements that need to be included in each page in this testing task, taking into account the original task requirements.

Follow the format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of testing tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks. 

### COMPOSITION

```

Task 1: Testing task 1 description

Task 2: Testing task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Task 1: []

Task 2: [Task 1]

```

Please note that: 

1) the format of your answer must strictly comply with the above form. Your description of the testing task must be in "COMPOSITION";

2) you don't need to modify the description of the default testing task.

The data will be stored in plain text format, where each journal entry will consist of the title, date, and content structured in the following way:
```
[Entry Title]|[Journal Entry Content]
```

### Data Examples
1. **File:** `data/journal_entries.txt`
```
My First Day|Today was a great day. I started my new job!
Weekend Adventures|Went hiking with friends this weekend. Beautiful weather!
```
2. **File:** `data/user_credentials.txt`
```
user1|password123
user2|mypassword
```
### File Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **File:** `journal_entries.txt` (for storing all journal entries)
  - **File:** `user_credentials.txt` (optional, for storing user information if needed)

This structure ensures that entries are easily readable and maintainable while allowing the web application to adequately function without the need for a SQL database..

        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_access(self):
        driver = self.driver
        
        # Check if the login page is accessible
        self.assertIn("Login", driver.title)
        
        # Check if the username input field is present
        username_input = driver.find_element(By.ID, "username_input")
        self.assertIsNotNone(username_input)
        
        # Check if the password input field is present
        password_input = driver.find_element(By.ID, "password_input")
