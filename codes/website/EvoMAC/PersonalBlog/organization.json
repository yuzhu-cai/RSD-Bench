        "Programmer 1": "Update the `main_blog` function in `app.py` to ensure that the `blog_title` is correctly rendered on the main blog page. Additionally, implement a button or link with the ID `view_post_button` for each blog post that allows users to view individual posts. This will resolve the issue of missing elements on the main blog page.",
        "Programmer 2": "Update the `view_post` function in `app.py` to ensure that it correctly handles the display of individual blog posts. Ensure that the function retrieves the post based on the title and passes the correct data to the `view_post.html` template.",
        "Programmer 3": "Update the `main_blog.html` file to include the `view_post_button` for each blog post. This button should link to the `view_post` route with the corresponding post title, allowing users to view individual posts.",
        "Programmer 4": "Update the `view_post.html` file to ensure that the `view_post_title` and `view_post_content` are displayed correctly. This involves verifying that the data passed from the `view_post` function is correctly rendered in the HTML.",
        "Programmer 5": "Implement the `test_main_blog_page_elements` function in the test suite to verify that all required elements are present on the main blog page, including `blog_title`, `new_post_button`, `view_post_button`, `post_list`, `logout_button`, and `blog_message`.",
        "Programmer 6": "Implement the `test_view_post_page_elements` function in the test suite to verify that all required elements are present on the view post page, including `view_post_title`, `view_post_content`, `edit_post_button`, `delete_post_button`, and `back_to_blog_button`."
