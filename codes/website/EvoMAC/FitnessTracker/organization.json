Fix the issue with the `view_activity` function by removing the reference to `activity_type_field`, which should not be present on the View Activity page. Ensure that all file read and write operations in the backend code are correctly implemented. Additionally, ensure that the login functionality correctly handles user credentials and that the session management is functioning as intended.",
        "Programmer 7": "Develop the frontend code for the `view_activity.html` page, ensuring that it displays the logged activities correctly without including an input field for `activity_type_field`. Ensure that all URLs in the frontend code are routes, not HTML file names. Verify that the activity log is displayed correctly and that the edit and delete buttons function as expected.",
        "Programmer 8": "Develop the frontend code for the `edit_activity.html` page, ensuring that all URLs in the frontend code are routes, not HTML file names. Ensure that the page correctly pre-fills the activity details for editing and does not reference any elements that are not present. Confirm that the save and cancel buttons work correctly and redirect to the appropriate pages."
