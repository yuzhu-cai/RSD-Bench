Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to decompose the overall coding plans into smaller tasks and assign them to different programmers.

The decomposition should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks. 

### COMPOSITION

```

Task 1: Task 1 description

Task 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Task 1: []

Task 2: [Task 1]

```

Please note that the decomposition should be both effective and efficient.

1) According to the Coding plan, each decomposed task should only be responsible for implementing one code file mentioned in Coding Plan.

2) Data files do not need to be assigned to programmers for implementation.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.

4) The first subtask should implement the backend code, while the REMAINING SUBTASKS should develop the frontend code based on backend codes.

5) Each code file should be assigned only one subtask; multiple subtasks for a single code file are not necessary.

6) If the subtask is to complete the frontend code, it should be explicitly noted in the subtask that all URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names.

7) If the subtask is to complete the backend code, it should include the following clear descriptions:

    - The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'.

    - The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code.

    - File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text.

In addition to these descriptions, the subtask should list all frontend code files and incorporate the original task's supplementary condition.

8) The workflow should not contain circles!

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

  - `login_button`: Button to submit login credentials and navigate to the Gallery Page
  - `error_message`: Display area for login errors

### 3.2. Gallery Page
- **Page Title:** Gallery
- **Overview:** This is the main page that displays the gallery of uploaded digital artworks and provides options to view, upload, or delete artworks.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `artwork_grid`: Container to display thumbnails of all artworks
  - `view_artwork_button`: Button to navigate to the View Artwork page to view the detailed text information about full-size artwork for the artwork whose title is same as that in artwork_title
  - `delete_artwork_button`: Button to delete the artwork whose title is same as that in artwork_title
  - `upload_artwork_button`: Button to navigate to the Upload Artwork page

### 3.3. View Artwork Page
- **Page Title:** View Artwork
- **Overview:** This page allows the user to view detailed text information about the target full-size artwork.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `full-size_artwork`: Container to display detailed text information about the target full-size artwork
  - `back_button`: Button to return to the gallery

### 3.4. Upload Artwork Page

The application will store data in local text files located in the `data` directory. Each type of data will be saved in a separate file to organize the information efficiently.

### Data Files
- **User Data File (`users.txt`)**:
  - Format: `username:password`
  - Example:
    ```
    john_doe:abcd1234
    jane_smith:xyz9876
    ```

- **Artwork Data File (`artworks.txt`):**:
  - Format: `artwork_id|title|description`
  - Example:
    ```
    1|Sunset Over the Hills|A beautiful sunset painting.
    2|Abstract Shapes|A collection of abstract shapes.
    ```

All text files will be created and accessed from the local `data` directory to ensure easy retrieval and management of information.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: # Requirements Document for DigitalArtworkGallery

## 1. Objective
Develop a comprehensive web application called 'DigitalArtworkGallery' that enables users to view, upload, and delete digital artworks without the need for a SQL database, leveraging Python and storing data in local text files.

## 2. Language
The required development language for this application is Python.

## 3. Page Design

### 3.1. Login Page
- **Page Title:** Login
- **Overview:** This page allows users to log into the application with their credentials.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `username_field`: Input field for the username
  - `password_field`: Input field for the password
  - `login_button`: Button to submit login credentials and navigate to the Gallery Page
  - `error_message`: Display area for login errors

### 3.2. Gallery Page
- **Page Title:** Gallery
- **Overview:** This is the main page that displays the gallery of uploaded digital artworks and provides options to view, upload, or delete artworks.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `artwork_grid`: Container to display thumbnails of all artworks
  - `view_artwork_button`: Button to navigate to the View Artwork page to view the detailed text information about full-size artwork for the artwork whose title is same as that in artwork_title
  - `delete_artwork_button`: Button to delete the artwork whose title is same as that in artwork_title
  - `upload_artwork_button`: Button to navigate to the Upload Artwork page

### 3.3. View Artwork Page
- **Page Title:** View Artwork
- **Overview:** This page allows the user to view detailed text information about the target full-size artwork.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `full-size_artwork`: Container to display detailed text information about the target full-size artwork
  - `back_button`: Button to return to the gallery

### 3.4. Upload Artwork Page
- **Page Title:** Upload Artwork
- **Overview:** This page allows users to upload a new digital artwork by providing a title and description.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `artwork_title_field`: Input field for the artwork title
  - `artwork_description_field`: Textarea for the artwork description
  - `upload_button`: Button to upload the artwork and return to the gallery
  - `cancel_button`: Button to discard changes and return to the gallery

## 4. Data Storage

### Data Format
The application will store data in local text files located in the `data` directory. Each type of data will be saved in a separate file to organize the information efficiently.

### Data Files
- **User Data File (`users.txt`)**:
  - Format: `username:password`
  - Example:
    ```
    john_doe:abcd1234
    jane_smith:xyz9876
    ```

- **Artwork Data File (`artworks.txt`):**:
  - Format: `artwork_id|title|description`
  - Example:
    ```
    1|Sunset Over the Hills|A beautiful sunset painting.
    2|Abstract Shapes|A collection of abstract shapes.
    ```

All text files will be created and accessed from the local `data` directory to ensure easy retrieval and management of information.
.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

After reviewing the provided code and requirements against the regulations set by ChatDev, here are the findings:

1. **Route Existence Check**: The `'/'` route exists in the backend code and correctly renders the login page. This complies with regulation 2.

2. **Frontend URLs**: The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for` function to generate URLs for routing, which is in line with regulation 3.

3. **Backend Routes**: The backend code establishes routes for each page (`/`, `/gallery`, `/view_artwork/<artwork_id>`, `/upload_artwork`, and `/login`), which corresponds to the frontend code. This complies with regulation 4.

4. **Password Encryption**: The application does not require encrypted passwords, which aligns with regulation 5.

5. **Data File Read Operations**: The `load_artworks` and `authenticate_user` functions read from the beginning of the data files, complying with regulation 6.

6. **Function and URL Correspondence**: All functions and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming, complying with regulation 7.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is the absence of a route and functionality to delete artworks. The frontend code for the gallery page includes a button for deleting artwork (`delete_artwork_button`), but there is no corresponding backend route or function to handle the deletion of artwork.

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this, you need to implement a route in the backend to handle the deletion of artworks. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Add a Route for Deleting Artwork**:
   Add the following function to your `app.py`:

   ```python
   @app.route('/delete_artwork/<artwork_id>', methods=['POST'])
   def delete_artwork(artwork_id):
       artworks = load_artworks()
       artworks = [artwork for artwork in artworks if artwork[0] != artwork_id]
       save_artworks(artworks)
       return redirect(url_for('gallery'))
   ```

2. **Implement the `save_artworks` Function**:
   You need a function to save the updated list of artworks back to the file:

   ```python
   def save_artworks(artworks):
       with open(ARTWORKS_FILE, 'w') as file:
           for artwork in artworks:
               file.write(f"{artwork[0]}|{artwork[1]}|{artwork[2]}\n")
   ```

3. **Update the Delete Button in `gallery.html`**:
   Change the delete button in `gallery.html` to use a POST request:

   ```html
   <form action="{{ url_for('delete_artwork', artwork_id=artwork[0]) }}" method="POST" style="display:inline;">
       <button id="delete_artwork_button" onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this artwork?');">Delete</button>
   </form>
   ```

### Summary:
By implementing the above changes, you will ensure that the application can handle artwork deletions, which is a critical functionality for the gallery. This will address the highest priority issue identified during the review.

Route Existence Check: The \'/\' route exists in the backend code and correctly renders the login page. This complies with regulation 2.\n\n2. Frontend URLs: The frontend code uses Flask\'s url_for function to generate URLs for routing, which is in line with regulation 3.\n\n3. Backend Routes: The backend code establishes routes for each page (/, /gallery, /view_artwork/&lt;artwork_id&gt;, /upload_artwork, and /login), which corresponds to the frontend code. This complies with regulation 4.\n\n4. Password Encryption: The application does not require encrypted passwords, which aligns with regulation 5.\n\n5. Data File Read Operations: The load_artworks and authenticate_user functions read from the beginning of the data files, complying with regulation 6.\n\n6. Function and URL Correspondence: All functions and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming, complying with regulation 7.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe highest priority issue is the absence of a route and functionality to delete artworks. The frontend code for the gallery page includes a button for deleting artwork (delete_artwork_button), but there is no corresponding backend route or function to handle the deletion of artwork.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nTo fix this, you need to implement a route in the backend to handle the deletion of artworks. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. Add a Route for Deleting Artwork:\n   Add the following function to your app.py:\n\n   python\n   @app.route(\'/delete_artwork/&lt;artwork_id&gt;\', methods=[\'POST\'])\n   def delete_artwork(artwork_id):\n       artworks = load_artworks()\n       artworks = [artwork for artwork in artworks if artwork[0] != artwork_id]\n       save_artworks(artworks)\n       return redirect(url_for(\'gallery\'))\n\n\n2. Implement the save_artworks Function:\n   You need a function to save the updated list of artworks back to the file:\n\n   python\n   def save_artworks(artworks):\n       with open(ARTWORKS_FILE, \'w\') as file:\n           for artwork in artworks:\n               file.write(f"{artwork[0]}|{artwork[1]}|{artwork[2]}\\n")\n\n\n3. Update the Delete Button in gallery.html:\n   Change the delete button in gallery.html to use a POST request:\n\n   html\n   &lt;form action="{{ url_for(\'delete_artwork\', artwork_id=artwork[0]) }}" method="POST" style="display:inline;"&gt;\n       &lt;button id="delete_artwork_button" onclick="return confirm(\'Are you sure you want to delete this artwork?\');"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;\n   &lt;/form&gt;\n\n\n### Summary:\nBy implementing the above changes, you will ensure that the application can handle artwork deletions, which is a critical functionality for the gallery. This will address the highest priority issue identified during the review.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"After reviewing the provided code and requirements against the regulations set by ChatDev, here are the findings:

1. **Route Existence Check**: The `'/'` route exists in the backend code and correctly renders the login page. This complies with regulation 2.

2. **Frontend URLs**: The frontend code uses Flask's `url_for` function to generate URLs for routing, which is in line with regulation 3.

3. **Backend Routes**: The backend code establishes routes for each page (`/`, `/gallery`, `/view_artwork/<artwork_id>`, `/upload_artwork`, and `/login`), which corresponds to the frontend code. This complies with regulation 4.

4. **Password Encryption**: The application does not require encrypted passwords, which aligns with regulation 5.

5. **Data File Read Operations**: The `load_artworks` and `authenticate_user` functions read from the beginning of the data files, complying with regulation 6.

6. **Function and URL Correspondence**: All functions and URLs in the frontend and backend code correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming, complying with regulation 7.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The highest priority issue is the absence of a route and functionality to delete artworks. The frontend code for the gallery page includes a button for deleting artwork (`delete_artwork_button`), but there is no corresponding backend route or function to handle the deletion of artwork.

### Suggested Revision:
To fix this, you need to implement a route in the backend to handle the deletion of artworks. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Add a Route for Deleting Artwork**:
   Add the following function to your `app.py`:

   ```python
   @app.route('/delete_artwork/<artwork_id>', methods=['POST'])
   def delete_artwork(artwork_id):
       artworks = load_artworks()
       artworks = [artwork for artwork in artworks if artwork[0] != artwork_id]
       save_artworks(artworks)
       return redirect(url_for('gallery'))
   ```

2. **Implement the `save_artworks` Function**:
   You need a function to save the updated list of artworks back to the file:

   ```python
   def save_artworks(artworks):
       with open(ARTWORKS_FILE, 'w') as file:
           for artwork in artworks:
               file.write(f"{artwork[0]}|{artwork[1]}|{artwork[2]}\n")
   ```

3. **Update the Delete Button in `gallery.html`**:
   Change the delete button in `gallery.html` to use a POST request:

   ```html
   <form action="{{ url_for('delete_artwork', artwork_id=artwork[0]) }}" method="POST" style="display:inline;">
       <button id="delete_artwork_button" onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this artwork?');">Delete</button>
   </form>
   ```

### Summary:
By implementing the above changes, you will ensure that the application can handle artwork deletions, which is a critical functionality for the gallery. This will address the highest priority issue identified during the review."

You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: # Requirements Document for DigitalArtworkGallery

## 1. Objective
Develop a comprehensive web application called 'DigitalArtworkGallery' that enables users to view, upload, and delete digital artworks without the need for a SQL database, leveraging Python and storing data in local text files.

## 2. Language
The required development language for this application is Python.

## 3. Page Design

### 3.1. Login Page
- **Page Title:** Login
- **Overview:** This page allows users to log into the application with their credentials.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `username_field`: Input field for the username
  - `password_field`: Input field for the password
  - `login_button`: Button to submit login credentials and navigate to the Gallery Page
  - `error_message`: Display area for login errors

### 3.2. Gallery Page
- **Page Title:** Gallery
- **Overview:** This is the main page that displays the gallery of uploaded digital artworks and provides options to view, upload, or delete artworks.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `artwork_grid`: Container to display thumbnails of all artworks
  - `view_artwork_button`: Button to navigate to the View Artwork page to view the detailed text information about full-size artwork for the artwork whose title is same as that in artwork_title
  - `delete_artwork_button`: Button to delete the artwork whose title is same as that in artwork_title
  - `upload_artwork_button`: Button to navigate to the Upload Artwork page

### 3.3. View Artwork Page
- **Page Title:** View Artwork
- **Overview:** This page allows the user to view detailed text information about the target full-size artwork.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `full-size_artwork`: Container to display detailed text information about the target full-size artwork
  - `back_button`: Button to return to the gallery

### 3.4. Upload Artwork Page
- **Page Title:** Upload Artwork
- **Overview:** This page allows users to upload a new digital artwork by providing a title and description.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `artwork_title_field`: Input field for the artwork title
  - `artwork_description_field`: Textarea for the artwork description
  - `upload_button`: Button to upload the artwork and return to the gallery
  - `cancel_button`: Button to discard changes and return to the gallery

## 4. Data Storage

### Data Format
The application will store data in local text files located in the `data` directory. Each type of data will be saved in a separate file to organize the information efficiently.

### Data Files
- **User Data File (`users.txt`)**:
  - Format: `username:password`
  - Example:
    ```
    john_doe:abcd1234
    jane_smith:xyz9876
    ```

- **Artwork Data File (`artworks.txt`):**:
  - Format: `artwork_id|title|description`
  - Example:
    ```
    1|Sunset Over the Hills|A beautiful sunset painting.
    2|Abstract Shapes|A collection of abstract shapes.
    ```

All text files will be created and accessed from the local `data` directory to ensure easy retrieval and management of information.
.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

'''
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class TestDigitalArtworkGallery(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        # Initialize the Chrome WebDriver
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")
    
    def test_login_page_accessibility(self):
        driver = self.driver

Here is the implementation of the test cases for the login functionality of the DigitalArtworkGallery web application, following the specified format:

test_requirement_2.py
```python
'''
Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task.
'''
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

class TestLoginPage(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_title(self):
        """Test if the login page is displayed correctly."""
        self.assertIn("Login", self.driver.title)

    def test_successful_login(self):
        """Test if the user can log in with valid credentials."""
        username = "john_doe"
        password = "abcd1234"

        # Locate the username and password fields
        username_field = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "username_field")
        password_field = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "password_field")
        login_button = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "login_button")

        # Input the credentials
        username_field.send_keys(username)
        password_field.send_keys(password)
        login_button.click()

        # Check if redirected to the gallery page
        self.assertIn("Gallery", self.driver.title)

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
``` 

This test script uses the `unittest` framework and `selenium` for web testing. It checks if the login page is displayed correctly and verifies that a user can log in with valid credentials. The `tearDown` method ensures that the browser is closed after the tests are completed.

- **Element IDs:**
  - `full-size_artwork`: Container to display detailed text information about the target full-size artwork
  - `back_button`: Button to return to the gallery

### 3.4. Upload Artwork Page
- **Page Title:** Upload Artwork
- **Overview:** This page allows users to upload a new digital artwork by providing a title and description.
- **Element IDs:**
  - `artwork_title_field`: Input field for the artwork title
  - `artwork_description_field`: Textarea for the artwork description
  - `upload_button`: Button to upload the artwork and return to the gallery
  - `cancel_button`: Button to discard changes and return to the gallery

## 4. Data Storage

### Data Format
The application will store data in local text files located in the `data` directory. Each type of data will be saved in a separate file to organize the information efficiently.

### Data Files
- **User Data File (`users.txt`)**:
  - Format: `username:password`
  - Example:
    ```
    john_doe:abcd1234
    jane_smith:xyz9876
    ```

- **Artwork Data File (`artworks.txt`):**:
  - Format: `artwork_id|title|description`
  - Example:
    ```
    1|Sunset Over the Hills|A beautiful sunset painting.
    2|Abstract Shapes|A collection of abstract shapes.
    ```

All text files will be created and accessed from the local `data` directory to ensure easy retrieval and management of information.
