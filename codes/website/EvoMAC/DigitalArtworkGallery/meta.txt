### Data Files
- **User Data File (`users.txt`)**:
  - Format: `username:password`
  - Example:
    ```
    john_doe:abcd1234
    jane_smith:xyz9876
    ```

    ```
    1|Sunset Over the Hills|A beautiful sunset painting.
    2|Abstract Shapes|A collection of abstract shapes.
    ```

All text files will be created and accessed from the local `data` directory to ensure easy retrieval and management of information.
