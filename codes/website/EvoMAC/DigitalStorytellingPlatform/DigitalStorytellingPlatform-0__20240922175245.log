### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to decompose the overall coding plans into smaller tasks and assign them to different programmers.

The decomposition should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks. 

### COMPOSITION

```

Task 1: Task 1 description

Task 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Task 1: []

Task 2: [Task 1]

```

Please note that the decomposition should be both effective and efficient.

1) According to the Coding plan, each decomposed task should only be responsible for implementing one code file mentioned in Coding Plan.

2) Data files do not need to be assigned to programmers for implementation.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.

4) The first subtask should implement the backend code, while the REMAINING SUBTASKS should develop the frontend code based on backend codes.

5) Each code file should be assigned only one subtask; multiple subtasks for a single code file are not necessary.

6) If the subtask is to complete the frontend code, it should be explicitly noted in the subtask that all URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names.

7) If the subtask is to complete the backend code, it should include the following clear descriptions:

    - The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'.

    - The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code.

    - File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text.

In addition to these descriptions, the subtask should list all frontend code files and incorporate the original task's supplementary condition.

8) The workflow should not contain circles!

 ### COMPOSITION

```
Task 1: Implement the backend code in `app.py`. 
- The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'.
- The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code.
- File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text.
- Frontend code files: `login.html`, `register.html`, `create_story.html`.

Task 2: Develop the frontend code for the Login Page in `login.html`.
- The page title should be "User Login".
- Include input fields for username and password, a login button, and a link to create an account.
- All URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names.

Task 3: Develop the frontend code for the Registration Page in `register.html`.
- The page title should be "User Registration".
- Include input fields for username, password, and email, along with a register button.
- All URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names.

Task 4: Develop the frontend code for the Story Creation Page in `create_story.html`.
- The page title should be "Create Your Story".
- Include input fields for story title and content, along with a save story button.
- All URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names.

Here is a new customer's task: # Requirements Document for Digital_Storytelling_Platform

## 1. Objective
Develop a comprehensive web application for a Digital Storytelling Platform that enables users to create, edit, and share their stories without the need for SQL databases.

## 2. Language
The required development language for this task is Python.

## 3. Page Design

### Page 1: Login Page (If the user successfully logs in, redirect them to the Story Creation Page.)
- **Page Title:** User Login
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `username_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Username"
  - ID: `password_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Password"
  - ID: `login_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Login"
  - ID: `register_link`(redirects to the registration page)
    - Type: Link
    - Text: "Create an Account"


## Page 2: Registration Page
- **Page Title:** User Registration
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `reg_username_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Username"
  - ID: `reg_password_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Password"
  - ID: `reg_email_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Email"
  - ID: `register_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Register"

### Page 3: Story Creation Page
- **Page Title:** Create Your Story
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `story_title_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Story Title"
  - ID: `story_content_field`
    - Type: Textarea
    - Placeholder: "Write your story here..."
  - ID: `save_story_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Save Story"





## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: # Requirements Document for Digital_Storytelling_Platform

## 1. Objective
Develop a comprehensive web application for a Digital Storytelling Platform that enables users to create, edit, and share their stories without the need for SQL databases.

## 2. Language
The required development language for this task is Python.

## 3. Page Design

### Page 1: Login Page (If the user successfully logs in, redirect them to the Story Creation Page.)
- **Page Title:** User Login
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `username_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Username"
  - ID: `password_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Password"
  - ID: `login_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Login"
  - ID: `register_link`(redirects to the registration page)
    - Type: Link
    - Text: "Create an Account"


## Page 2: Registration Page
- **Page Title:** User Registration
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `reg_username_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Username"
  - ID: `reg_password_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Password"
  - ID: `reg_email_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Email"
  - ID: `register_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Register"

### Page 3: Story Creation Page
- **Page Title:** Create Your Story
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `story_title_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Story Title"
  - ID: `story_content_field`
    - Type: Textarea
    - Placeholder: "Write your story here..."
  - ID: `save_story_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Save Story"





## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 
Task: "".

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision.

## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, here are my findings:

### Regulation Compliance Check

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The code uses `app.run(port=5000)`, which is correct.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The `login()` function is mapped to the `'/'` route, which is correct.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** The frontend code uses `{{ url_for('login') }}`, `{{ url_for('register') }}`, and `{{ url_for('create_story') }}` correctly, which is compliant.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** The routes for login, registration, and story creation are correctly established in the backend.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement password encryption, which is compliant with the requirement.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** The `read_users()` function reads from the beginning of the file, which is compliant.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** All function names and URLs correspond correctly between the frontend and backend.

### Highest Priority Comment and Suggestions

**Comment:** The `create_story()` function does not handle user authentication properly. The `user_id` is being fetched from the form data using `request.form['username']`, but this value is not being set anywhere in the session after login. Therefore, when a user tries to create a story, the `user_id` will not correspond to the logged-in user.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. After a successful login, store the username in the session:
   ```python
   @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def login():
       '''Render the login page and handle user authentication.'''
       if request.method == 'POST':
           username = request.form['username']
           password = request.form['password']
           users = read_users()
           if username in users and users[username] == password:
               session['username'] = username  # Store username in session
               return redirect(url_for('create_story'))  # Redirect to story creation page
           else:
               return "Invalid credentials", 401
       return render_template('login.html')
   ```

2. Modify the `create_story()` function to retrieve the `user_id` from the session:
   ```python
   @app.route('/create_story', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def create_story():
       '''Handle story creation.'''
       if 'username' not in session:
           return redirect(url_for('login'))  # Redirect to login if not authenticated
       if request.method == 'POST':
           user_id = session['username']  # Get username from session
           story_title = request.form['story_title_field']
           story_content = request.form['story_content_field']
           write_story(user_id, story_title, story_content)
           return redirect(url_for('create_story'))  # Redirect to story creation page after saving
       return render_template('create_story.html')
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will correctly associate the stories with the logged-in user, ensuring proper functionality of the Digital Storytelling Platform.

Comments on Codes:
"After reviewing the provided code and the regulations set forth by ChatDev, here are my findings:

### Regulation Compliance Check

1. **The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.**
   - **Compliance:** The code uses `app.run(port=5000)`, which is correct.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.**
   - **Compliance:** The `login()` function is mapped to the `'/'` route, which is correct.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.**
   - **Compliance:** The frontend code uses `{{ url_for('login') }}`, `{{ url_for('register') }}`, and `{{ url_for('create_story') }}` correctly, which is compliant.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.**
   - **Compliance:** The routes for login, registration, and story creation are correctly established in the backend.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.**
   - **Compliance:** The code does not implement password encryption, which is compliant with the requirement.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.**
   - **Compliance:** The `read_users()` function reads from the beginning of the file, which is compliant.

7. **Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.**
   - **Compliance:** All function names and URLs correspond correctly between the frontend and backend.

### Highest Priority Comment and Suggestions

**Comment:** The `create_story()` function does not handle user authentication properly. The `user_id` is being fetched from the form data using `request.form['username']`, but this value is not being set anywhere in the session after login. Therefore, when a user tries to create a story, the `user_id` will not correspond to the logged-in user.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. After a successful login, store the username in the session:
   ```python
   @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def login():
       '''Render the login page and handle user authentication.'''
       if request.method == 'POST':
           username = request.form['username']
           password = request.form['password']
           users = read_users()
           if username in users and users[username] == password:
               session['username'] = username  # Store username in session
               return redirect(url_for('create_story'))  # Redirect to story creation page
           else:
               return "Invalid credentials", 401
       return render_template('login.html')
   ```

2. Modify the `create_story()` function to retrieve the `user_id` from the session:
   ```python
   @app.route('/create_story', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def create_story():
       '''Handle story creation.'''
       if 'username' not in session:
           return redirect(url_for('login'))  # Redirect to login if not authenticated
       if request.method == 'POST':
           user_id = session['username']  # Get username from session
           story_title = request.form['story_title_field']
           story_content = request.form['story_content_field']
           write_story(user_id, story_title, story_content)
           return redirect(url_for('create_story'))  # Redirect to story creation page after saving
       return render_template('create_story.html')
   ```

By implementing these changes, the application will correctly associate the stories with the logged-in user, ensuring proper functionality of the Digital Storytelling Platform."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

Here is a new customer's task: # Requirements Document for Digital_Storytelling_Platform

## 1. Objective
Develop a comprehensive web application for a Digital Storytelling Platform that enables users to create, edit, and share their stories without the need for SQL databases.

## 2. Language
The required development language for this task is Python.

## 3. Page Design

### Page 1: Login Page (If the user successfully logs in, redirect them to the Story Creation Page.)
- **Page Title:** User Login
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `username_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Username"
  - ID: `password_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Password"
  - ID: `login_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Login"
  - ID: `register_link`(redirects to the registration page)
    - Type: Link
    - Text: "Create an Account"


## Page 2: Registration Page
- **Page Title:** User Registration
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `reg_username_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Username"
  - ID: `reg_password_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Password"
  - ID: `reg_email_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Email"
  - ID: `register_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Register"

### Page 3: Story Creation Page
- **Page Title:** Create Your Story
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `story_title_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Story Title"
  - ID: `story_content_field`
    - Type: Textarea
    - Placeholder: "Write your story here..."
  - ID: `save_story_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Save Story"





## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..

2) Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task.

In addition, there are other testing tasks as well:

You need to assign ONE testing task to test the elements and integrity of ALL pages.

In order to write testing code, you need to clearly describe the elements that need to be included in each page in this testing task, taking into account the original task requirements.

Follow the format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of testing tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks. 

### COMPOSITION

```

Task 1: Testing task 1 description

Task 2: Testing task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Task 1: []

Task 2: [Task 1]

```

Please note that: 

1) the format of your answer must strictly comply with the above form. Your description of the testing task must be in "COMPOSITION";

2) you don't need to modify the description of the default testing task.

## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### COMPOSITION

    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here is the implementation of the test requirement as per your specifications:

test_requirement_1.py
```python
'''
Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000, specifically testing the login page.
'''
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class TestLoginPageAccess(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_access(self):
        # Check if the login page is accessible
        time.sleep(2)  # Wait for the page to load
        self.assertIn("User Login", self.driver.title)  # Verify the title of the page
        
        # Check if the username field is present
        username_field = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "username_field")
        self.assertIsNotNone(username_field)

        # Check if the password field is present
        password_field = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "password_field")
        self.assertIsNotNone(password_field)

        # Check if the login button is present
        login_button = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "login_button")
        self.assertIsNotNone(login_button)

        # Check if the register link is present
        register_link = self.driver.find_element(By.ID, "register_link")
        self.assertIsNotNone(register_link)

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

This code implements the test case to check if the login page can be accessed through the local port 5000. It verifies the presence of essential elements on the login page and ensures that the page title is correct. The test is structured to be executed using the unittest framework and utilizes Selenium for web automation.

  - ID: `reg_username_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Username"
  - ID: `reg_password_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Password"
  - ID: `reg_email_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Email"
  - ID: `register_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Register"

### Page 3: Story Creation Page

## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: # Requirements Document for Digital_Storytelling_Platform

## 1. Objective
Develop a comprehensive web application for a Digital Storytelling Platform that enables users to create, edit, and share their stories without the need for SQL databases.

## 2. Language
The required development language for this task is Python.

## 3. Page Design

### Page 1: Login Page (If the user successfully logs in, redirect them to the Story Creation Page.)
- **Page Title:** User Login
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `username_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Username"
  - ID: `password_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Password"
  - ID: `login_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Login"
  - ID: `register_link`(redirects to the registration page)
    - Type: Link
    - Text: "Create an Account"


## Page 2: Registration Page
- **Page Title:** User Registration
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `reg_username_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Username"
  - ID: `reg_password_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Password"
  - ID: `reg_email_input`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Enter Email"
  - ID: `register_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Register"

### Page 3: Story Creation Page
- **Page Title:** Create Your Story
- **Element List:**
  - ID: `story_title_field`
    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Story Title"
  - ID: `story_content_field`
    - Type: Textarea
    - Placeholder: "Write your story here..."
  - ID: `save_story_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Save Story"





## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here is the implementation of the test case for the login functionality of the Digital Storytelling Platform, following the specified format and requirements:

test_requirement_2.py
```python
'''
Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task.
'''
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class TestLoginPage(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_title(self):
        """Test if the login page title is correct."""
        self.assertIn("User Login", self.driver.title)

    def test_login_functionality(self):
        """Test if the login functionality works with valid credentials."""
        driver = self.driver
        
        # Locate the username and password fields
        username_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "username_field")
        password_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "password_field")
        login_button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "login_button")

        # Input valid credentials
        username_field.send_keys("johndoe")
        password_field.send_keys("password123")
        login_button.click()

        # Wait for redirection
        time.sleep(2)

        # Check if redirected to the Story Creation Page
        self.assertIn("Create Your Story", driver.title)

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

This code includes:
- A test case to verify that the login page title is correct.
- A test case to check the login functionality using the provided credentials.
- Proper setup and teardown methods to manage the WebDriver instance.

    - Type: Input
    - Placeholder: "Story Title"
  - ID: `story_content_field`
    - Type: Textarea
    - Placeholder: "Write your story here..."
  - ID: `save_story_button`
    - Type: Button
    - Text: "Save Story"





## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Our software requirements and developed source codes are listed below: 
Programming Language: "Python and HTML"
Testing Task description: "Test the elements and integrity of ALL pages, ensuring that each page contains the required elements as specified in the original task requirements 
- Login Page  Check for the presence of `username_field`, `password_field`, `login_button`, and `register_link`.
- Registration Page  Check for the presence of `reg_username_input`, `reg_password_input`, `reg_email_input`, and `register_button`.
- Story Creation Page  Check for the presence of `story_title_field`, `story_content_field`, and `save_story_button`."
According to Testing Task description, please write test cases to locate the bugs, note that logging is important, ensure the content and format is right. 
You should first locate the functions that need to be tested and write the test cases for them according to the testing task description.
The output must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is "test_requirement_3.py", "LANGUAGE" in the programming language,"REQUIREMENTS" is the targeted requirement of the test case, and "CODE" is the test code that is used to test the specific requirement of the file. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
REQUIREMENTS
'''
CODE
```
You will implement the "test_requirement_3.py" and finish it follows in the strictly defined format.
Please note that:
1. Please adhere strictly to the Testing Task description to develop unit test code for the web application using Python, Selenium, and unittest framework. 
2. The test code needs to be directly executable and only need to cover the tests required by the Testing Task description.
3. Chrome WebDriver is already installed and the path is in the environment variable, so there is no need to specify its path in the test code. And 'WebDriver' object has no attribute 'find_element_by_id'
4. Access to the login page is available at http://localhost:5000. Navigation is restricted to http://localhost:5000 exclusively via the driver.get() method; navigation to other URLs is not allowed.
5. You must utilize the username and password from Data Storage to construct a login method within the test class. 
6. Access to All pages, except for the login and registration pages, requires logging in from the login page and then proceeding by clicking the corresponding buttons on the page to navigate to the desired page.
7. After logging in, you will be redirected to other pages and will not stay on the login page.
