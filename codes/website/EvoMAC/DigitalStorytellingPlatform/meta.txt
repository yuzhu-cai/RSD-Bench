## 4. Data Storage
Data, including user information and stories, will be stored in local text files within a directory named `data`. The data will be managed in the following format:

### Data Format
* User Data: 
  - Format: `username|password` (one user per line)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|password123
    janedoe|securepass456
    ```

* Story Data:
  - Format: `user_id|story_title|story_content` (one story per line, user ID represents the author)
  - Example:
    ```
    johndoe|My First Adventure|Once upon a time in a land far away
    janedoe|The Mysterious Forest|In a dark and enchanted forest
    ```

### File Structure
- Directory: `data/`
  - File 1: `users.txt` (stores user credentials)
  - File 2: `stories.txt` (stores stories created by users)

This structured approach ensures easy access and management of user data and stories without relying on an SQL database.
