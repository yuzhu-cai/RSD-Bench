### Data Format
TravelDiary will store data in the local text files. Each type of data will be segregated into its own file. All files will be saved in the directory `data`.

### Data Examples
1. **Users Data (users.txt)**:
   - data format: username,password,email
   ```
   john_doe,password1,john@example.com
   jane_smith,pass213,jane@example.com
   ```

2. **Diary Entries Data (diary_entries.txt)**:
   - data format: entryId,username,title,content
   ```
   1,john_doe,Trip to Paris,Had a wonderful time soaking in the sights...
   2,jane_smith,Beach Vacation,Relaxed at the beach with friends...
   ```

### Directory Structure
- **Directory:** `data/`
  - **Files:**
    - `users.txt` (Contain user registration details)
    - `diary_entries.txt` (Contain all diary entries)

The TravelDiary application will implement this structure to effectively manage user and diary entry information while ensuring reliable data handling without the need for SQL database technology.
