  - Format: `username:password`
  - Example:
    ```
    john_doe:abcd1234
    jane_smith:xyz9876
    ```

- **Retreat Data File (`retreats.txt`):**:
  - Format: `retreat_id|retreat_id|title|date|time|instructor`
  - Example:
    ```
    1|john_doe|Morning Yoga|2024-09-01|08:00 AM|Instructor A
    2|john_doe|Mindfulness Meditation|2024-09-02|10:00 AM|Instructor B
    ```

All text files will be created and accessed from the local `data` directory to ensure easy retrieval and management of information.
