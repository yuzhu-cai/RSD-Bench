    john_doe:abcd1234
    jane_smith:xyz9876
    ```

- **Event Data File (`events.txt`)**:
  - Format: `event_id|title|date|location|description`
  - Example:
    ```
    1|Team Meeting|2024-08-30|Conference Room A|Discuss project updates.
    2|Annual Conference|2024-09-15|Grand Hall|Networking sessions.
    ```

All text files will be created and accessed from the local `data` directory to ensure easy retrieval and management of information.
