| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Task description: "{description}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas:"{ideas}" Requirements:"{requirements}" Coding plan: "{codes}" Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to decompose the overall coding plans into smaller tasks and assign them to different programmers. The decomposition should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks.  COMPOSITION ``` Task 1: Task 1 description Task 2: Task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Task 1: [] Task 2: [Task 1] ``` Please note that the decomposition should be both effective and efficient. 1) According to the Coding plan, each decomposed task should only be responsible for implementing one code file mentioned in Coding Plan. 2) Data files do not need to be assigned to programmers for implementation. 3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task. 4) The first subtask should implement the backend code, while the REMAINING SUBTASKS should develop the frontend code based on backend codes. 5) Each code file should be assigned only one subtask; multiple subtasks for a single code file are not necessary. 6) If the subtask is to complete the frontend code, it should be explicitly noted in the subtask that all URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names. 7) If the subtask is to complete the backend code, it should include the following clear descriptions: - The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'.  - The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code.  - File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text.  In addition to these descriptions, the subtask should list all frontend code files and incorporate the original task's supplementary condition. 8) The workflow should not contain circles! |

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to decompose the overall coding plans into smaller tasks and assign them to different programmers.

The decomposition should be in the following format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks. 

### COMPOSITION

```

Task 1: Task 1 description

Task 2: Task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Task 1: []

Task 2: [Task 1]

```

Please note that the decomposition should be both effective and efficient.

1) According to the Coding plan, each decomposed task should only be responsible for implementing one code file mentioned in Coding Plan.

2) Data files do not need to be assigned to programmers for implementation.

3) If there is a corresponding description in the original task, please include it in the subtask and clearly and structurally highlight the key requirements of the task.

4) The first subtask should implement the backend code, while the REMAINING SUBTASKS should develop the frontend code based on backend codes.

5) Each code file should be assigned only one subtask; multiple subtasks for a single code file are not necessary.

6) If the subtask is to complete the frontend code, it should be explicitly noted in the subtask that all URLs in the frontend code should be routes, not HTML file names.

7) If the subtask is to complete the backend code, it should include the following clear descriptions:

    - The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, and the login page can be directly accessed through the route '/'.

    - The backend code must implement routing for all frontend pages, ensuring that each route corresponds to the frontend code.

    - File read and write operations in the backend code should start from the first line of the file, without any encryption, using plain text.

In addition to these descriptions, the subtask should list all frontend code files and incorporate the original task's supplementary condition.

8) The workflow should not contain circles!

| **task_prompt** | Requirements Document for OnlineCulturalExchange 1. Objective The objective of the OnlineCulturalExchange web application is to facilitate cultural exchange among users by providing a user-friendly platform to share and explore global cultures without the need for a SQL database. 2. Language The required development language for this application is Python. 3. Page Design 3.1. Page Overview The web application will consist of the following pages:  Login Page Page Title: Login Element IDs: login-form: Main form container username: Username input field password: Password input field login-button: Submit button error-message: Container for error messages    Navigation:  Successful login redirects to the Home Page. Unsuccessful login stays on the Login Page with an error message.    Home Page  Page Title: Home Element IDs: welcome-message: Welcome message area culture-list: List of available cultural exchange topics culture-item-&lt;index&gt;(where &lt;index&gt; is the number starting from 0): Hyperlink to redirect to specific Cultural Exchange Pages profile-link: Hyperlink to redirect to the Profile Page contact-link: Hyperlink to redirect to the Contact Page    Navigation:  Users can navigate to the Profile Page, or Contact Page using the corresponding hyperlinks. Users can navigate to specific Cultural Exchange Pages by selecting topics and using the corresponding hyperlinks from the culture-list.    Cultural Exchange Page  Page Title: Cultural Exchange Element IDs: exchange-form: Main form for submissions title: Title input field for the exchange description: Description textarea for details submit-exchange: Button to submit the exchange exchange-list: List of submitted exchanges exchange-item: Individual exchange item display home-link: Hyperlink to redirect back to the Home Page    Navigation:  Users can return to the Home Page using the home-link.    Profile Page  Page Title: Profile Element IDs: profile-header: Header for user profile username-display: Display area for username logout-button: Button to log out home-link: Hyperlink to redirect back to the Home Page    Navigation:  Users can return to the Home Page using the home-link. Clicking the logout-button will redirect the user back to the Login Page.    Contact Page  Page Title: Contact Element IDs: contact-form: Main form for contact inquiries contact-name: Input field for name contact-email: Input field for email address contact-message: Textarea for message send-message-button: Button to send the message contact-confirmation: Area to show submission status home-link: Hyperlink to redirect back to the Home Page   Navigation: Users can return to the Home Page using the home-link.    4. Data Storage 4.1 Data Format Data will be stored in local .txt files, organized in the data directory. The format will be plain text, one entry per line for lists, and comma-separated values for individual records. 4.2 Data Examples   User Information (stored in data/users.txt):   username1,password1   username2,password2   Cultural Exchange Submissions (stored in data/exchanges.txt):   Cultural Title 1,Description of cultural exchange 1   Cultural Title 2,Description of cultural exchange 2   Contact Messages (stored in data/contacts.txt):   Name 1,email1@example.com,Message from user 1   Name 2,email2@example.com,Message from user 2   4.3 Directory Structure The application will have the following directory structure for storing data: /OnlineCulturalExchange   └── data       ├── users.txt       ├── exchanges.txt       └── contacts.txt This structured approach ensures that all user-generated content and interactions are efficiently stored and easily accessible for the application’s operations. |

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format: FILENAME LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE |

## 4. Data Storage

### 4.1 Data Format
Data will be stored in local `.txt` files, organized in the `data` directory. The format will be plain text, one entry per line for lists, and comma-separated values for individual records.

### 4.2 Data Examples

- **User Information** (stored in `data/users.txt`):
  ```
  username1,password1
  username2,password2
  ```

- **Cultural Exchange Submissions** (stored in `data/exchanges.txt`):
  ```
  Cultural Title 1,Description of cultural exchange 1
  Cultural Title 2,Description of cultural exchange 2
  ```

- **Contact Messages** (stored in `data/contacts.txt`):
  ```
  Name 1,email1@example.com,Message from user 1
  Name 2,email2@example.com,Message from user 2
  ```

### 4.3 Directory Structure
The application will have the following directory structure for storing data:
```
/OnlineCulturalExchange
  └── data
      ├── users.txt
      ├── exchanges.txt
      └── contacts.txt
```

This structured approach ensures that all user-generated content and interactions are efficiently stored and easily accessible for the application’s operations..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format: FILENAME LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE |

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

## 4. Data Storage

### 4.1 Data Format
Data will be stored in local `.txt` files, organized in the `data` directory. The format will be plain text, one entry per line for lists, and comma-separated values for individual records.

### 4.2 Data Examples

- **User Information** (stored in `data/users.txt`):
  ```
  username1,password1
  username2,password2
  ```

- **Cultural Exchange Submissions** (stored in `data/exchanges.txt`):
  ```
  Cultural Title 1,Description of cultural exchange 1
  Cultural Title 2,Description of cultural exchange 2
  ```

- **Contact Messages** (stored in `data/contacts.txt`):
  ```
  Name 1,email1@example.com,Message from user 1
  Name 2,email2@example.com,Message from user 2
  ```

### 4.3 Directory Structure
The application will have the following directory structure for storing data:
```
/OnlineCulturalExchange
  └── data
      ├── users.txt
      ├── exchanges.txt
      └── contacts.txt
```

This structured approach ensures that all user-generated content and interactions are efficiently stored and easily accessible for the application’s operations..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **task_prompt** | Requirements Document for OnlineCulturalExchange 1. Objective The objective of the OnlineCulturalExchange web application is to facilitate cultural exchange among users by providing a user-friendly platform to share and explore global cultures without the need for a SQL database. 2. Language The required development language for this application is Python. 3. Page Design 3.1. Page Overview The web application will consist of the following pages:  Login Page Page Title: Login Element IDs: login-form: Main form container username: Username input field password: Password input field login-button: Submit button error-message: Container for error messages    Navigation:  Successful login redirects to the Home Page. Unsuccessful login stays on the Login Page with an error message.    Home Page  Page Title: Home Element IDs: welcome-message: Welcome message area culture-list: List of available cultural exchange topics culture-item-&lt;index&gt;(where &lt;index&gt; is the number starting from 0): Hyperlink to redirect to specific Cultural Exchange Pages profile-link: Hyperlink to redirect to the Profile Page contact-link: Hyperlink to redirect to the Contact Page    Navigation:  Users can navigate to the Profile Page, or Contact Page using the corresponding hyperlinks. Users can navigate to specific Cultural Exchange Pages by selecting topics and using the corresponding hyperlinks from the culture-list.    Cultural Exchange Page  Page Title: Cultural Exchange Element IDs: exchange-form: Main form for submissions title: Title input field for the exchange description: Description textarea for details submit-exchange: Button to submit the exchange exchange-list: List of submitted exchanges exchange-item: Individual exchange item display home-link: Hyperlink to redirect back to the Home Page    Navigation:  Users can return to the Home Page using the home-link.    Profile Page  Page Title: Profile Element IDs: profile-header: Header for user profile username-display: Display area for username logout-button: Button to log out home-link: Hyperlink to redirect back to the Home Page    Navigation:  Users can return to the Home Page using the home-link. Clicking the logout-button will redirect the user back to the Login Page.    Contact Page  Page Title: Contact Element IDs: contact-form: Main form for contact inquiries contact-name: Input field for name contact-email: Input field for email address contact-message: Textarea for message send-message-button: Button to send the message contact-confirmation: Area to show submission status home-link: Hyperlink to redirect back to the Home Page   Navigation: Users can return to the Home Page using the home-link.    4. Data Storage 4.1 Data Format Data will be stored in local .txt files, organized in the data directory. The format will be plain text, one entry per line for lists, and comma-separated values for individual records. 4.2 Data Examples   User Information (stored in data/users.txt):   username1,password1   username2,password2   Cultural Exchange Submissions (stored in data/exchanges.txt):   Cultural Title 1,Description of cultural exchange 1   Cultural Title 2,Description of cultural exchange 2   Contact Messages (stored in data/contacts.txt):   Name 1,email1@example.com,Message from user 1   Name 2,email2@example.com,Message from user 2   4.3 Directory Structure The application will have the following directory structure for storing data: /OnlineCulturalExchange   └── data       ├── users.txt       ├── exchanges.txt       └── contacts.txt This structured approach ensures that all user-generated content and interactions are efficiently stored and easily accessible for the application’s operations. |

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format: FILENAME LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE |

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

| **task_prompt** | Requirements Document for OnlineCulturalExchange 1. Objective The objective of the OnlineCulturalExchange web application is to facilitate cultural exchange among users by providing a user-friendly platform to share and explore global cultures without the need for a SQL database. 2. Language The required development language for this application is Python. 3. Page Design 3.1. Page Overview The web application will consist of the following pages:  Login Page Page Title: Login Element IDs: login-form: Main form container username: Username input field password: Password input field login-button: Submit button error-message: Container for error messages    Navigation:  Successful login redirects to the Home Page. Unsuccessful login stays on the Login Page with an error message.    Home Page  Page Title: Home Element IDs: welcome-message: Welcome message area culture-list: List of available cultural exchange topics culture-item-&lt;index&gt;(where &lt;index&gt; is the number starting from 0): Hyperlink to redirect to specific Cultural Exchange Pages profile-link: Hyperlink to redirect to the Profile Page contact-link: Hyperlink to redirect to the Contact Page    Navigation:  Users can navigate to the Profile Page, or Contact Page using the corresponding hyperlinks. Users can navigate to specific Cultural Exchange Pages by selecting topics and using the corresponding hyperlinks from the culture-list.    Cultural Exchange Page  Page Title: Cultural Exchange Element IDs: exchange-form: Main form for submissions title: Title input field for the exchange description: Description textarea for details submit-exchange: Button to submit the exchange exchange-list: List of submitted exchanges exchange-item: Individual exchange item display home-link: Hyperlink to redirect back to the Home Page    Navigation:  Users can return to the Home Page using the home-link.    Profile Page  Page Title: Profile Element IDs: profile-header: Header for user profile username-display: Display area for username logout-button: Button to log out home-link: Hyperlink to redirect back to the Home Page    Navigation:  Users can return to the Home Page using the home-link. Clicking the logout-button will redirect the user back to the Login Page.    Contact Page  Page Title: Contact Element IDs: contact-form: Main form for contact inquiries contact-name: Input field for name contact-email: Input field for email address contact-message: Textarea for message send-message-button: Button to send the message contact-confirmation: Area to show submission status home-link: Hyperlink to redirect back to the Home Page   Navigation: Users can return to the Home Page using the home-link.    4. Data Storage 4.1 Data Format Data will be stored in local .txt files, organized in the data directory. The format will be plain text, one entry per line for lists, and comma-separated values for individual records. 4.2 Data Examples   User Information (stored in data/users.txt):   username1,password1   username2,password2   Cultural Exchange Submissions (stored in data/exchanges.txt):   Cultural Title 1,Description of cultural exchange 1   Cultural Title 2,Description of cultural exchange 2   Contact Messages (stored in data/contacts.txt):   Name 1,email1@example.com,Message from user 1   Name 2,email2@example.com,Message from user 2   4.3 Directory Structure The application will have the following directory structure for storing data: /OnlineCulturalExchange   └── data       ├── users.txt       ├── exchanges.txt       └── contacts.txt This structured approach ensures that all user-generated content and interactions are efficiently stored and easily accessible for the application’s operations. |

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Sub-Task description: "{subtask}" Codes: "{codes}" Coding plan: "{coding_plan}" As the {assistant_role}, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask. You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask. You DO NOT need to implement any other code files. If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it. If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output  None. Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format. If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening. If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name. Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code. Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported. You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format: FILENAME LANGUAGE ''' DOCSTRING ''' CODE |

As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all functions which are related to the subtask.
You ONLY need to complete ONE code file mentioned in the subtask.
You DO NOT need to implement any other code files.
If you have modified a certain part of the source code, please output all the code in the modified code file in its entirety without omitting it.
If the code file for the subtask description has already been implemented in the above Codes and does not require any modifications, please output <INFO> None.
Note that both the logicshould be fully functional! No placeholder (such as 'pass' in Python), strictly following the required format.
If the task is to complete the backend code, carefully reference the frontend code files to generate the corresponding backend code. The website should be accessible via the local port 5000, with the login page as the first page displayed upon opening.
If the task is to complete the frontend code, the URLs for the linked pages must be specified as routes, not an HTML file name.
Note that the front-end code is solely responsible for the presentation and interaction of the website's pages, while all functionalities are implemented by the back-end code.
Finally, ensure the functions are consistent among different files, and correctely imported.
You should output the code content in ONE file. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code.

| **phase_prompt** | According to the new user's task and our software designs:  Task: "{task}". Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes: "{codes}" As the {assistant_role}, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations: 1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000. 2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first. 3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names. 4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code. 5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password. 6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file. 7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming. Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) The entire website project can be accessed at http://localhost:5000.
2) the login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'. Please confirm whether the '/' route exists first.
3) The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names.
4) The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code.
5) This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password.
6) All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file.
7) Please review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, to ensure it COMPLIES with each regulations. Please propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision.

## 4. Data Storage

### 4.1 Data Format
Data will be stored in local `.txt` files, organized in the `data` directory. The format will be plain text, one entry per line for lists, and comma-separated values for individual records.

### 4.2 Data Examples

- **User Information** (stored in `data/users.txt`):
  ```
  username1,password1
  username2,password2
  ```

- **Cultural Exchange Submissions** (stored in `data/exchanges.txt`):
  ```
  Cultural Title 1,Description of cultural exchange 1
  Cultural Title 2,Description of cultural exchange 2
  ```

- **Contact Messages** (stored in `data/contacts.txt`):
  ```
  Name 1,email1@example.com,Message from user 1
  Name 2,email2@example.com,Message from user 2
  ```

### 4.3 Directory Structure
The application will have the following directory structure for storing data:
```
/OnlineCulturalExchange
  └── data
      ├── users.txt
      ├── exchanges.txt
      └── contacts.txt
```

This structured approach ensures that all user-generated content and interactions are efficiently stored and easily accessible for the application’s operations..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Upon reviewing the provided code and requirements against the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified the following compliance checks:

1. **Access to the entire website project at http://localhost:5000**: 
   - The code provided does allow the application to run on this port, so this requirement is met.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'**: 
   - The route for the login page is defined as `@app.route('/')`, which is correct. This requirement is met.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names**: 
   - The frontend code uses `url_for()` to generate URLs for routing, which is compliant with this requirement.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code**: 
   - The backend code has defined routes for `/`, `/home`, `/cultural_exchange`, `/profile`, and `/contact`, which correspond correctly to the frontend code. This requirement is met.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password**: 
   - The code does not implement any password encryption, which is compliant with this requirement.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file**: 
   - The `read_users()` and `read_exchanges()` functions read from the beginning of their respective files, which is compliant with this requirement.

7. **Review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming**: 
   - All functions and URLs in the backend code correspond correctly to the frontend code.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue identified is the lack of user authentication logic in the login process. While the login page is set up, there is no functionality to validate the username and password against the data stored in `data/users.txt`. This is essential for the application to function correctly, as users need to be authenticated before accessing other pages.

### Suggested Revision:
To implement user authentication, you should modify the `login()` function in `app.py` to handle POST requests for user login. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Update the `login()` function to check the username and password against the data read from `data/users.txt`.

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    '''Render the login page and handle login logic.'''
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        users = read_users()
        if username in users and users[username] == password:
            session['username'] = username  # Store username in session
            return redirect(url_for('home'))  # Redirect to home page on successful login
        else:
            flash('Invalid username or password. Please try again.')
    return render_template('login.html')
```

2. Ensure to import `session` from Flask at the beginning of your `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, session
```

3. Update the `profile.html` to display the username only if the user is logged in:

```html
<div id="username-display">
    {% if session['username'] %}
        <p>Username: {{ session['username'] }}</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>Not logged in.</p>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the login functionality works as intended, allowing users to authenticate before accessing the rest of the application.

            session['username'] = username  # Store username in session
            return redirect(url_for('home'))  # Redirect to home page on successful login
        else:
            flash('Invalid username or password. Please try again.')
    return render_template('login.html')

        <p>Username: {{ session['username'] }}</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>Not logged in.</p>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the login functionality works as intended, allowing users to authenticate before accessing the rest of the application.

'images': '', 'comments': 'Upon reviewing the provided code and requirements against the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified the following compliance checks:\n\n1. Access to the entire website project at http://localhost:5000: \n   - The code provided does allow the application to run on this port, so this requirement is met.\n\n2. The login page can be accessed directly via the route \'/\': \n   - The route for the login page is defined as @app.route(\'/\'), which is correct. This requirement is met.\n\n3. The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names: \n   - The frontend code uses url_for() to generate URLs for routing, which is compliant with this requirement.\n\n4. The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code: \n   - The backend code has defined routes for /, /home, /cultural_exchange, /profile, and /contact, which correspond correctly to the frontend code. This requirement is met.\n\n5. This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password: \n   - The code does not implement any password encryption, which is compliant with this requirement.\n\n6. All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file: \n   - The read_users() and read_exchanges() functions read from the beginning of their respective files, which is compliant with this requirement.\n\n7. Review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming: \n   - All functions and URLs in the backend code correspond correctly to the frontend code.\n\n### Highest Priority Comment:\nThe most critical issue identified is the lack of user authentication logic in the login process. While the login page is set up, there is no functionality to validate the username and password against the data stored in data/users.txt. This is essential for the application to function correctly, as users need to be authenticated before accessing other pages.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\nTo implement user authentication, you should modify the login() function in app.py to handle POST requests for user login. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. Update the login() function to check the username and password against the data read from data/users.txt.\n\npython\n@app.route(\'/\', methods=[\'GET\', \'POST\'])\ndef login():\n    \'\'\'Render the login page and handle login logic.\'\'\'\n    if request.method == \'POST\':\n        username = request.form[\'username\']\n        password = request.form[\'password\']\n        users = read_users()\n        if username in users and users[username] == password:\n            session[\'username\'] = username  # Store username in session\n            return redirect(url_for(\'home\'))  # Redirect to home page on successful login\n        else:\n            flash(\'Invalid username or password. Please try again.\')\n    return render_template(\'login.html\')\n\n\n2. Ensure to import session from Flask at the beginning of your app.py:\n\npython\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, session\n\n\n3. Update the profile.html to display the username only if the user is logged in:\n\nhtml\n&lt;div id="username-display"&gt;\n    {% if session[\'username\'] %}\n        &lt;p&gt;Username: {{ session[\'username\'] }}&lt;/p&gt;\n    {% else %}\n        &lt;p&gt;Not logged in.&lt;/p&gt;\n    {% endif %}\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nBy implementing these changes, you will ensure that the login functionality works as intended, allowing users to authenticate before accessing the rest of the application.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"Upon reviewing the provided code and requirements against the regulations set forth by ChatDev, I have identified the following compliance checks:

1. **Access to the entire website project at http://localhost:5000**: 
   - The code provided does allow the application to run on this port, so this requirement is met.

2. **The login page can be accessed directly via the route '/'**: 
   - The route for the login page is defined as `@app.route('/')`, which is correct. This requirement is met.

3. **The URLs in the frontend code should be provided through routing rather than using local HTML file names**: 
   - The frontend code uses `url_for()` to generate URLs for routing, which is compliant with this requirement.

4. **The backend code needs to establish routes for each page, ensuring that these routes correspond directly to those used in the frontend code**: 
   - The backend code has defined routes for `/`, `/home`, `/cultural_exchange`, `/profile`, and `/contact`, which correspond correctly to the frontend code. This requirement is met.

5. **This website is only an example and does not require an encrypted password**: 
   - The code does not implement any password encryption, which is compliant with this requirement.

6. **All data file read operations should start from the first line of the data file**: 
   - The `read_users()` and `read_exchanges()` functions read from the beginning of their respective files, which is compliant with this requirement.

7. **Review each function and URL in the frontend and backend code to ensure they correspond correctly, with no discrepancies in naming**: 
   - All functions and URLs in the backend code correspond correctly to the frontend code.

### Highest Priority Comment:
The most critical issue identified is the lack of user authentication logic in the login process. While the login page is set up, there is no functionality to validate the username and password against the data stored in `data/users.txt`. This is essential for the application to function correctly, as users need to be authenticated before accessing other pages.

### Suggested Revision:
To implement user authentication, you should modify the `login()` function in `app.py` to handle POST requests for user login. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Update the `login()` function to check the username and password against the data read from `data/users.txt`.

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    '''Render the login page and handle login logic.'''
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        users = read_users()
        if username in users and users[username] == password:
            session['username'] = username  # Store username in session
            return redirect(url_for('home'))  # Redirect to home page on successful login
        else:
            flash('Invalid username or password. Please try again.')
    return render_template('login.html')
```

2. Ensure to import `session` from Flask at the beginning of your `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, session
```

3. Update the `profile.html` to display the username only if the user is logged in:

```html
<div id="username-display">
    {% if session['username'] %}
        <p>Username: {{ session['username'] }}</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>Not logged in.</p>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```

By implementing these changes, you will ensure that the login functionality works as intended, allowing users to authenticate before accessing the rest of the application."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Here is a new customer's task: # Requirements Document for OnlineCulturalExchange

## 1. Objective
The objective of the OnlineCulturalExchange web application is to facilitate cultural exchange among users by providing a user-friendly platform to share and explore global cultures without the need for a SQL database.

## 2. Language
The required development language for this application is Python.

## 3. Page Design

### 3.1. Page Overview
The web application will consist of the following pages:

1. **Login Page**
   - **Page Title**: Login
   - **Element IDs**:
     - `login-form`: Main form container
     - `username`: Username input field
     - `password`: Password input field
     - `login-button`: Submit button
     - `error-message`: Container for error messages
   - **Navigation**:
     - Successful login redirects to the **Home Page**.
     - Unsuccessful login stays on the **Login Page** with an error message.

2. **Home Page**
   - **Page Title**: Home
   - **Element IDs**:
     - `welcome-message`: Welcome message area
     - `culture-list`: List of available cultural exchange topics
       - `culture-item-<index>`(where `<index>` is the number starting from 0): Hyperlink to redirect to specific **Cultural Exchange Pages**
     - `profile-link`: Hyperlink to redirect to the **Profile Page**
     - `contact-link`: Hyperlink to redirect to the **Contact Page**
   - **Navigation**:
     - Users can navigate to the **Profile Page**, or **Contact Page** using the corresponding hyperlinks.
     - Users can navigate to specific **Cultural Exchange Pages** by selecting topics and using the corresponding hyperlinks from the `culture-list`.

3. **Cultural Exchange Page**
   - **Page Title**: Cultural Exchange
   - **Element IDs**:
     - `exchange-form`: Main form for submissions
     - `title`: Title input field for the exchange
     - `description`: Description textarea for details
     - `submit-exchange`: Button to submit the exchange
     - `exchange-list`: List of submitted exchanges
     - `exchange-item`: Individual exchange item display
     - `home-link`: Hyperlink to redirect back to the **Home Page**
   - **Navigation**:
     - Users can return to the **Home Page** using the `home-link`.
  
4. **Profile Page**
   - **Page Title**: Profile
   - **Element IDs**:
     - `profile-header`: Header for user profile
     - `username-display`: Display area for username
     - `logout-button`: Button to log out
     - `home-link`: Hyperlink to redirect back to the **Home Page**
   - **Navigation**:
     - Users can return to the **Home Page** using the `home-link`.
     - Clicking the `logout-button` will redirect the user back to the **Login Page**.

5. **Contact Page**
   - **Page Title**: Contact
   - **Element IDs**:
     - `contact-form`: Main form for contact inquiries
     - `contact-name`: Input field for name
     - `contact-email`: Input field for email address
     - `contact-message`: Textarea for message
     - `send-message-button`: Button to send the message
     - `contact-confirmation`: Area to show submission status
     - `home-link`: Hyperlink to redirect back to the **Home Page**
   - **Navigation**:
     - Users can return to the **Home Page** using the `home-link`.

## 4. Data Storage

### 4.1 Data Format
Data will be stored in local `.txt` files, organized in the `data` directory. The format will be plain text, one entry per line for lists, and comma-separated values for individual records.

### 4.2 Data Examples

- **User Information** (stored in `data/users.txt`):
  ```
  username1,password1
  username2,password2
  ```

- **Cultural Exchange Submissions** (stored in `data/exchanges.txt`):
  ```
  Cultural Title 1,Description of cultural exchange 1
  Cultural Title 2,Description of cultural exchange 2
  ```

- **Contact Messages** (stored in `data/contacts.txt`):
  ```
  Name 1,email1@example.com,Message from user 1
  Name 2,email2@example.com,Message from user 2
  ```

### 4.3 Directory Structure
The application will have the following directory structure for storing data:
```
/OnlineCulturalExchange
  └── data
      ├── users.txt
      ├── exchanges.txt
      └── contacts.txt
```

This structured approach ensures that all user-generated content and interactions are efficiently stored and easily accessible for the application’s operations..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| **phase_prompt** | According to the software requirements listed below:  Modality: "website". Programming Language: "Python and HTML" Your goal is to organize a testing team to complete the software development task. There are two default testing tasks:  1) Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000. In this test, you only need to test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local 5000 port. 2) Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task. In addition, there are other testing tasks as well: You need to assign ONE testing task to test the elements and integrity of ALL pages. In order to write testing code, you need to clearly describe the elements that need to be included in each page in this testing task, taking into account the original task requirements. Follow the format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of testing tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks.  COMPOSITION ``` Task 1: Testing task 1 description Task 2: Testing task 2 description ``` WORKFLOW ``` Task 1: [] Task 2: [Task 1] ``` Please note that:  1) the format of your answer must strictly comply with the above form. Your description of the testing task must be in "COMPOSITION"; 2) you don't need to modify the description of the default testing task. |

```

This structured approach ensures that all user-generated content and interactions are efficiently stored and easily accessible for the application’s operations..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the software requirements listed below: 

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: "Python and HTML"

Your goal is to organize a testing team to complete the software development task.

There are two default testing tasks: 

1) Test whether the website can be accessed through local port 5000. In this test, you only need to test whether the login page of the website can be accessed through the local 5000 port.

2) Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task.

In addition, there are other testing tasks as well:

You need to assign ONE testing task to test the elements and integrity of ALL pages.

In order to write testing code, you need to clearly describe the elements that need to be included in each page in this testing task, taking into account the original task requirements.

Follow the format: "COMPOSITION" is the composition of testing tasks, and "Workflow" is the workflow of the programmers. Each task is assigned to a programmer, and the workflow shows the dependencies between tasks. 

### COMPOSITION

```

Task 1: Testing task 1 description

Task 2: Testing task 2 description

```

### WORKFLOW

```

Task 1: []

Task 2: [Task 1]

```

Please note that: 

1) the format of your answer must strictly comply with the above form. Your description of the testing task must be in "COMPOSITION";

2) you don't need to modify the description of the default testing task.

```

This structured approach ensures that all user-generated content and interactions are efficiently stored and easily accessible for the application’s operations..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here is the implementation of the test case according to the specified format and requirements:

test_requirement_1.py
```python
'''
Test whether the login page of the OnlineCulturalExchange web application can be accessed through local port 5000.
'''
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class TestLoginPageAccess(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")

    def test_login_page_access(self):
        driver = self.driver
        time.sleep(2)  # Wait for the page to load

        # Check if the login form is present
        try:
            login_form = driver.find_element(By.ID, "login-form")
            self.assertIsNotNone(login_form, "Login form is not found.")
            print("Login form is accessible.")
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Failed to access the login page: {str(e)}")

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
``` 

This code defines a unit test for the OnlineCulturalExchange web application, specifically testing the accessibility of the login page via the local port 5000. It uses the Selenium library to automate the browser and check for the presence of the login form. The test is structured to log important information and handle exceptions appropriately.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Our software requirements and developed source codes are listed below: 
Programming Language: "Python and HTML"
Testing Task description: "Test whether the first page of the website is the login page and whether it can log in correctly based on the example data provided in the Task."
According to Testing Task description, please write test cases to locate the bugs, note that logging is important, ensure the content and format is right. 
You should first locate the functions that need to be tested and write the test cases for them according to the testing task description.
The output must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is "test_requirement_2.py", "LANGUAGE" in the programming language,"REQUIREMENTS" is the targeted requirement of the test case, and "CODE" is the test code that is used to test the specific requirement of the file. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
REQUIREMENTS
'''
CODE
```
You will implement the "test_requirement_2.py" and finish it follows in the strictly defined format.
Please note that:
1. Please adhere strictly to the Testing Task description to develop unit test code for the web application using Python, Selenium, and unittest framework. 
2. The test code needs to be directly executable and only need to cover the tests required by the Testing Task description.
3. Chrome WebDriver is already installed and the path is in the environment variable, so there is no need to specify its path in the test code. And 'WebDriver' object has no attribute 'find_element_by_id'
4. Access to the login page is available at http://localhost:5000. Navigation is restricted to http://localhost:5000 exclusively via the driver.get() method; navigation to other URLs is not allowed.
5. You must utilize the username and password from Data Storage to construct a login method within the test class. 
6. Access to All pages, except for the login and registration pages, requires logging in from the login page and then proceeding by clicking the corresponding buttons on the page to navigate to the desired page.
7. After logging in, you will be redirected to other pages and will not stay on the login page.

from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class TestLoginPage(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        self.driver.get("http://localhost:5000")
        self.driver.implicitly_wait(10)

    def test_login_page_title(self):
        """Test if the first page is the login page."""
        self.assertIn("Login", self.driver.title)

    def test_successful_login(self):
        """Test if the login works with valid credentials."""
        username = "username1"  # Example username from data
        password = "password1"  # Example password from data
