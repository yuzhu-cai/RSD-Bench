Modify the login page to always render the `error_message` element, even when empty.\n- Ensure that the `write_festival` function handles the case where the `admin_message` element is not present on the Add Festival page by ensuring it is always rendered in the HTML.",
        "Programmer 2": "Develop the frontend code in **templates/add_festival.html**. \n- This HTML file allows users to input new festival information, including name, location, date, and lineup, along with a submit button and a display area for success/error messages.\n- Ensure that the `admin_message` element is always present in the HTML, even if it is empty, to prevent `NoSuchElementException` during testing."
