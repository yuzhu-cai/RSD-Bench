This is necessary to ensure that the test for the consultation scheduling page passes successfully. Additionally, ensure that the confirmation message is displayed correctly after scheduling a consultation.",

This button should be defined with an ID `feedback_button` instead of using an `onclick` event. The button should redirect users to the feedback page when clicked."
